A quote from Glosa 6000 (3rd edition, page 7) which
may or may not(?) relate to this question (i.e. is
Glosa a semantically based language?)


Each Glosa word stands for only one concept. In the
Old Languages, whole battalions of words looking and
sounding different, may yet contain a large element of
common meaning. In Glosa, which is a semantically
based language, this common meaning is made explicit.
