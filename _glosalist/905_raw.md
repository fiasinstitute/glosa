I have read the "18 Steps" with great pleasure. It's an excellent   
web si=
te. But there is something that concerned me throughout. I  
found it is di=
scouraging to read that there are so many errors in  
the original book; pe=
rhaps there are a lot more. Not to mention it  
is insulting to the origina=
l authors for telling the whole world  
what horrible work they've done.
