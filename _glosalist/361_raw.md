Saluta Robin,



I have begun to study the Glosa, and I found the needing o=
f possesive pronouns:
"Mi matri ergo in domi."

In the hungarian language, =
for example, sometimes you can use nouns as verbs:
"to mother" does mean: "=
to say dirty words". I think, this mode of using nouns may be find even in =
other languages.

So, "Mi matri ergo in domi"  for a hungarian can give the=
 undermentioned sense:
"I am saying dirty words while I am working inside t=
he house."

But for example:
"Mi-a matri ergo in domi." - could give you a =
better understanding. Or a different solution that you will find more opprt=
une.

Constructive intentionned,

Laslo
