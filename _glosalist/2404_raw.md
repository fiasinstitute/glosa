	The Kid seldom smiled; but he smiled and waved his hat when he saw her.
> U Juve-an no-freqe labia-ridi.  Anti-co an monstra u labia-ridi e oscila u kefa-ve, kron an vide fe.

He dismounted, and his girl sprang into his arms.
> An kine a kata.  Po-co an gina salta ad an bi braki.

The Kid looked at her fondly.
> U Juve-an filo skope fe.

His thick, black hair clung to his head like a wrinkled mat.
> An densi, melano kapila es ge-glu a kefa homo u ruga tape.

The meeting brought a slight ripple of some undercurrent of feeling to
his smooth, dark face that was usually as motionless as a clay mask.
> U saluta kausa u mikro sema ex no-vista este ad an glabro, melano facia; qi norma habe minus moti homo facia kripti-ru ex kerami.
