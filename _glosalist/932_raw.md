I wish not change the Glosa word order system. I just have indicate a
way t=
o make possible a alternative order if it need.

But I have any problems wh=
en I try to read Glosa texts. For example,
in the story "Roberti u an visit=
a a Skarbro" by Syd Pidd, in the part
n=B04: 

"Andro itera feno enigma"
Wh=
at it's mean?
"Andro" is a unknowed man? Roberti is this man? "Andro" is a =
man or a
husband? 
"enigma": the man seems strange or he seems thinking?
"A=
n kresce ma e ma enigma": who is "AN" and what he increases? 
"enigma tem" =
: tem is a noun or a preposition, enigma is a adjective
(enigma tem) or the=
 object of verb kresce?

Where is the problem? In my brain ('am afraid), in=
 a defectuous use of
Glosa (sorry Syd, for a so inelegant hypothesis) or in=
 the own rules
of Glosa?

Other things:
- for listeners, how do the differe=
nce between "vora-mo" and "vora
mo"? I think that the difficulty became of =
number name. Use usually
the greek word MONO seems better and inambiguous w=
ith "-MO", only use
MO as number in a suite, because BI MO SIX or MO PENTA =
makes not mistake.
-- "sko-pe" and "skope". Change skope for skopo or skopa=
 solves the
homophony.
--- I have seen any other little spines, but I forge=
t! It's for a
other day.

Mi saluta vi, mi ami
