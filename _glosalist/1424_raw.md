Hello, Liogab11!

No, it wasn't me, I've never been to an Esperanto Congr=
ess. Oleg is rather a popular name in Russia, you see.

About Glosa. At pre=
sent I'm getting through the "18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa" and have s=
ome difficulty in parsing one of the examples:

"Tu debi gene tako more Glo=
sa kogita.=A0 You should quickly get accustomed thinking in Glosa."

In my =
opinion, there are two variants of translation possible:

1) Tu debi (gene =
tako more) (Glosa kogita). =3D You should quickly get accustomed to thinkin=
g in Glosa.

2) Tu debi (gene tako) (more Glosa kogita). =3D You should get=
 accustomed to thinking quickly in Glosa. (or: "to quick Glosa thinking"). =


It seems to me, that due to the fact that Glosa hasn't got a particular m=
arker for verb phrases (but only that for noun phrases), it's sometimes dif=
ficult to understand the true meaning of some sentences. Is there any way t=
o make the meaning of this phrase clearly distinguishable? Or is the second=
 translation impossible?

Best regards,
Oleg
