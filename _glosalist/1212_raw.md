Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniosis

"Lungs full of ultra(-)micro(-)scopic (beyond-tiny-view) volcanic sand,"
if you look up each word in Marcel's Glosa Internet Dictionary.  Put
hyphens between the parts if you want:
pneumono-ultra-micro-scopic-silico-volcani-osis; it does make it a little
easier.  Glosa is great for building vocabulary, isn't it?

The names of all the elements are the same as you will see them on the
periodic table, but in Latin.  "Iron" is Fe on the periodic table, in
Glosa FERU(S), so of course they both start with FE.  Many larger English
dictionaries will give you the Latin term.  "Gold" is Au for Latin AURUM;
you can also use the Greek root KRISO (chrysanthemum = gold flower).

As I wrote to Marcel not too long ago, there will always be a reason to
learn Glosa.  In the future, computers may be able to translate
Esperanto, Interlingua, etc., but Glosa will still have the big advantage
of improving the scientific/technical vocabulary of anyone who takes the
time to learn it.
