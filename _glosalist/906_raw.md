I agree that while the language itself is a great
achievement and very well thought out, the basic manual has
some failings. I would like to create a better manual if
possible and have started to work on that.  I would like
also to (re)-create the audio file for samples of the
language. I would need some help with that as I am not 100%
sure of my own pronunciation.

There is a multimedia program for learning Esperanto the
would be a very useful tool to get training material out
for Glosa. It is called Kurso de esperanto. and I think you
can get the framework of it and change it to Glosa.


The only problem I have and it is minor, if the way the
numbers below 100 are called without the ten or deka. I
mean 37 is tri seti and not trideka seti.  For consistency
I think it should be the latter. 


Thanks,


Tom
