	The Kid crept noiselessly to the very edge of the pear thicket and
reconnoitred between the leaves of a clump of cactus.
> U Juve-an kine minus fono a margina de kaktus densi-lo, e skope dia plu kaktus "folia."

	Ten yards from his hiding-place, in the shade of the /jacal/, sat his
Tonia calmly plaiting a rawhide lariat.
> Deka metra ab kripti-lo in umbra de domi, an Tonia sedi, tem paci plekto u bovi-derma fi-fa.

So far she might surely escape condemnation; women have been known,
from time to time, to engage in more mischievous occupations.
> A-kron fe sura ne habe etio.  Plu gina kron a kron akti plu ma kako ra.

But if all must be told, there is to be added that her head reposed
against the broad and comfortable chest of a tall red-and-yellow man,
and that his arm was about her, guiding her nimble fingers that
required so many lessons at the intricate six-strand plait.
