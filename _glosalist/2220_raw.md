Ave,

after six years I took a look again at Glosa and I still like it, eve=
n though I have some questions about the derivation of the Glosa roots them=
selves. I hope you can give me hint or two=85

(I'm referring to the GID: h=
ttp://www.glosa.org/gid/glen.htm and the derivation rules described in Wiki=
pedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glosa#Word_Derivation_.5B6.5D .They don=
't seem to fit. Are there any derivation rules at all?)

We got "noktu", "l=
akti" and "fonta", but the latin ablative forms are "nocte", "lacte" and "f=
onte". What's the reason for -u, -i and -a in Glosa?

We got "honora", "kal=
ori", "odoro", "amo", but the latin ablative forms are "honore", "calore", =
"odore", "amore". What's the reason for "-ora", "-ori", "-oro", "-o" in Glo=
sa?

We got "kredi" and "rapi", but the latin infinitives are "credere" and=
 "rapere", so why it's not "krede" and "rape" in Glosa?

Why is it "lekto" =
and "tensio" instead of "lekti" and "tensi" when we have "nati" (from "lect=
io", "tensio" and "natio")?

Why is it "grafo" (grafein/grafe), "strofi" (s=
trofein/strofe) when we have "kine" (kinein/kine), "skope" (skopein/skope)?=


Why is it "imperi" for both "command" and "empire" when we have "nati" fo=
r "birth" and "natio" for "nation"?

Why is it "bestia" instead of "besti" =
when we have "glori" instead of "gloria"?

Why we have "alti", "puri", "bel=
i", "mali" when we have "karo" and "lento"?

Why we have "kali" instead of =
"kalo", when we have "termo"?

Why is it "stupidi" and "solidi" when we hav=
e "tepido" (>> "stupido", "solido"), or even "frigi" and "splendi" (>> "stu=
pi", "soli")?

Why we have "kaso" and "stato" when we have "manu", "gradu",=
 "faktu", "latu"?

Why we have "kardia" instead of "kardi", when we have "h=
istori", "spongi", "melodi", "sofi"?

Why we have "spaci" instead of "spati=
", when we have "palati"?

I'm uncertain about greek nouns/adjectives with =
-ika. There are "logika", "fisika", "tipika" and also "logi", "fisio", "tip=
o". I wouldn't know what to expect

Regards,
Stephan
