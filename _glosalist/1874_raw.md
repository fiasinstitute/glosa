Hi Xavier,
 
     Thanks a lot for making the entire text of Interglossa a=
vailable online.  That's amazing!  
 
      The best Glosa dictionary is th=
e GID (Glosa Internet Dictionary), and you can download it here:  http://ww=
w.glosa.org/gid/index.html.  I like the PDF version the best.  The best res=
ource for learning Glosa is here:  
http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm.  It's=
 pretty easy to make fast progress with the language (because of the langua=
ge's isolating character and its small number of roots).  I started learnin=
g the language in December of last year, and it's pretty easy for me to con=
verse and translate using the language now.  
 
If you have any questions, =
feel free to ask them here.   
 
Welcome,
Ian

Subject: =
[glosalist] Interglossa and Glosa


  



Hello. I'm sorry for not writing =
in Glosa, I'm new at this group.
I already know the handbook of Interglossa=
, and I have scanned up to text. I invite you to see it online: https://sit=
es.google.com/site/interglossa1943/

I would like to know what is the best =
dictionary of GLOSA I may use to learn the language now. If possible, a dic=
tionary indicating the categories of every word (n., v., adj., adv., prep.,=
 and so on).
Actually the handbook of Interglossa presented the vocabulary =
in this way.

Thanks in advance.
