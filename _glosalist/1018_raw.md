Hello Evgeniy,

   In answer to your questions I inform you of the following - (taken from Glosa text books):
   
  Accent (stress)  is "gently on the vowel before the final consonant"

  S is pronounced as in English "ess" - I am unaware of the Z pronunciation

  I believe that Gratia should be pronounced "grAtia" - again I am unaware of "gratsia" (sounds like the Spanish word).

I am no authority on Glosa and can only tell you what is said in my text books - I would be interested if any other Glosa speakers give you different 
information.   
   
      Wishing you well and for a better world.       Regards,   David J Porter

  Subject: [glosalist] hello all


  The Glosa is a very intresting auxilary language for me.

  I seek Russian speakers who are intresting Glosa. Write me directly, please.

  I have some questions about pronunciation.
  1 what is correct accent grAtia or gratIa?
  2I hear in audio examples that sometime S sound like Z (as in Zoo)
  especially in intervocal position (as in German)
  3 In word 'gratia' I hear T sound like TS. Is it correct?

  Thanks.
