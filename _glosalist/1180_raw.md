  If you care to send me your postal address I can post you a copy of the 18 steps that I took from my original book - you can reply to my email address:-
  davidjenningsp@...
     Regards,   David JP




  Thanks for that.

  I can't get hold of anyone at www.secondhand-bookshop.co.uk (and their web site searching and ordering doesn't seem to work) and so have ordered from Waterstones, who have subsequently sent me an email to say that it is unavailable from their suppliers.

  I know that it is available on the Glosa web site - I have it printed out - but wanted the 'real' copy to get the missing examples from the book that are omitted in the online version.

  Again, thanks for taking the time to reply.
