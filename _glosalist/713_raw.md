I accidentally sent a part-formed reply.

As I was going to say -- I think a conlang's success relies on getting
it out in the popular consciousness, through things like literature,
magazines, music, and film.  The best thing you could do would be to
find a director willing to shoot short films in an auxiliary language,
so that there would then be some actual material for interested people
to be exposed to the language.  Glosa, like several other IAL projects
I think could develop into something major given a chance, seems mostly
to be the stuff of introverted journals.  At this point, even a blog in
the language would be a big step.
