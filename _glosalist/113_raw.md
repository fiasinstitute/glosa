A language, also an auxlang, must be able to express two-faced things.

I think, Nick comes from England.  I imagine, that his text is also 
from England.  So I cannot see any "USA-hegemony" nor 
"White-House-philosphy" in it, nothing political, nothing national. 

Glosalist is a place, where we CREATE culture (auxlang culture!).  It 
is NOT the place, where we FIGHT AGAINST other cultures, not against 
the one from USA nor wherever from.  Everyone is welcome here, who 
respects the others.  Please make that always clear! 


Nick's and Gary's text shows, how a conversation could be started in 
Glosa.  Why not starting with polite small-talk like "how do you do?"? 
We will not be able to go deeper, if we do not start talking.  Please 
be aware: Glosa has too few conversation and it is weak yet in learning 
material.  A trophy for everyone who tries to change that! 

Mi dice fo gratia a Nick e Gary de u-ci textu.  Mi spe; vi fu dura u-ci 
ergo e mi atende kon entusi plu seqe mero de id!  Saluta.  Marcel
