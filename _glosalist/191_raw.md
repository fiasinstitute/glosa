Panto karo Glosa-pe:

I just got a letter today from a certain Mr. Rao from India.  He says he
is learning Glosa there.  (The letter was in English).  He lives in a
rural area of India but is promoting Glosa and has started a library and
a social-help organization named after Mother Teresa there.  He would
like donations of books for his library or information on social projects
that people in his area can get involved in.  Any spread of this
information would also be appreciated.  His address is:
