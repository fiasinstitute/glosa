Hello Glosa-pe

I just put up a Glosa page at my site, www.thebranchhearth.net
It isn't anything yet. Hopefully I can add to it weekly and in time, ...

My vocabulary of the core for reading is at around 1000. It took about a 
month and a half to get there. I imagine two months is reasonable for 
the full core.

Anyway, all the site has is a link to glosa.org, the flashcards for 
fullrecall and a link to the GID.
