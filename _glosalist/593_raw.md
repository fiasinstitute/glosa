* The inflections, beloved of people who are good 
at languages, do not suit everybody.  Glosa has 
"Syntax-based Grammar" and thus the sequencing of 
the words gives the language its grammar.  Less 
words and less inflections: fine!

*  Quite so.    A study of 'Good Syntax' seems
necessary.
With clearly thought-out syntax, the function of 
each word ought to be clear, and thus, the 
meaning of the whole sentence should, accordingly,
also be meaningful.

    I have found most Glosa sentences easy to read,
but

* Usually because the writer has tried to be too 
economical with words, and has over-used the few
present.

* Interesting: the idea of a 'VERB cluster' seems to
have thrown you.
         The ~iso~ is more of a "verb auxilliary" 
than anything. In this sentence structure, the 
~iso~ is 'helping' the VERB ~dice~, so acts as 
either a Modifier (=adverb) or an Auxillary to 
the verb.   The whole VERB Clause (=verb cluster) 
would be ~dice iso~.  This sentence uses the
Intransitive form.

>In the first sentence, is the verbal cluster, 'dice',
>'dice iso', or perhaps even
>'ami dice iso'?
* Running a simple S-V-O test on this sentence, it is:

                        S           -      V
             Panto Cina ami  -  dice iso.        
...OR

       Fancifully, with a three-word VERB Clause

                    S          -         V
              Panto Cina  -  ami dice iso.
             ( all  China      love say the-same)
[either]  All China loves to say the same.
[or]       All China lovingly says the same.

  I'd award these sentences a "*" suggesting that they
did not go.


>Literally the sentence says:
>" all china friend say identical"
* It is a very handy trick to use the glos 
(direct word translation), either explicitly as I 
have done here, or in your head - like looking at 
your cards before working out the value of your 
hand.  NB The simple word-translation dictionary 
produced by the Glosa authors was all they could 
afford, but to use it requires imagination.


>Assuming that 'dice' is the verb, are pan cina ami
>agreeing with the criticism
>in the first sentence that Glosa is too much like
>English, or are they saying
>that Glosa is like Chinese, which the third sentence
>seems to say ?
* Yes, the reported speech is uttered as a 
criticism.  The concluding sentence is an 
affirmation of the value of Glosa's syntax.
      I have communicated with both groups, 
English-speakers who say Glosa is simply English 
'relexified', and Chinese-speakers who say they 
recognise in Glosa the same syntax as in their own
language.

      Solution of conundrum:

     Well-written Glosa can usually be 
translitterated word for word into English.
BUT
     English does not translitterate directly into
Glosa.

     Explanation:

     Glosa demands the use of correct syntax, 
otherwise its 'grammar' does not work!

     In English with its minimal bag of 
inflections, and through [sloppy] usage, we get 
away with lingustic murder in our syntax.
     The brain recognises utterances in English 
as meaningful by seeing the patterns of usage and
converting them into meaning.
      In Glosa we have no body of usage to fall 
back on, and we must observe the niceties of 
proper syntax, otherwise we talk Glosa-Gobbledegook.
      Unfortunately Syntax has not been taught in 
schools; fortunately for me, however, I am old 
enough to have gone to school in Queensland when 
Parsing and Analysis was still being taught in Primary
Schools.

      Personal belief:
      By imposing the need for good sentence 
structure on its speakers, Glosa ensures much 
less ambiguity [and deceit] in in the usage of
language.

      Glosa Rules:
     1. A word is modified by its preceding word.
     2. Glosa sentences use Subject-Verb-Object
structure.
     3. Within phrases, 'head final" structure
applies.

       This last rule says that the major word in 
a phrase is the last word of the phrase, and, for 
the other words, the least important starts the 
phrase, while subsequent words leading to the 
major word build up in significance.  This 
happens in English with Noun Phrases, e.g.

      the three large fat high-school boys    <try
re-arranging the order>

>In the third sentence I assume that the verb is
either
>funktio, or iso, or both.
>I can, I think, get the meaning, but it would be nice
>to be sure.
* All language has some fuzziness Glosa just does 
it differently.  But it is annoying all the same.

>In the above example it is a just bit annoying, but
in
>a different context it could
>mean that a reader comes away with totally the wrong
>meaning, and that is the sort
>of thing that would put people off Glosa.
* Yip, creatives like it, but the less imaginitive
find it a bit off-putting.

>May I, as an outsider, suggest that perhaps a 'nu'
>could be slipped into such
>sentences to split off the subject cluster from the
>verbal cluster. The easier it
>is to read, the more people may want to read it.
* Such an idea has been put forward.  ~nu~ has an 
exact funtion: it puts things into the immediate
present.
   ~Mi vide an,~ has a different meaning from ~Mi nu
vide an.~

    If you have this sort of trouble, you could 
use ^trainer wheels^ at the start to help you
recognise the VERB Phrase.

   e.g.    Plu tri ju-an /fo hedo voko/ ko plu ridi
ju-fe.

      The three boys very happily talked with the
laughing girls.

   NB The "^" is such an invention to denote the 
use of non-literal language. It is not supposed 
to be used in Glosa, but this is a rule which I find
unnecessarily restricting.

>I have also noticed that there are older versions of
>the vocabulary in existence,
>and it is not clear which one you should be using.
>This is surely not helpful to anyone wishing to learn
>Glosa.
* Quite so, but the matter never really got sorted
out.

>Sorry for the criticism, but it is meant to be
>contructive. *** I think the secret of
>Glosa is to write clearly and simply, even if it
takes
>a few more words to do so, and
>that the writer should take care to ensure that the
>reader will easily be able to
>understand what has been written.***
* I call it reading out loud what you have 
written and seeing if what you hear reminds you of the
meant to say.
   If the answer is 'NO', then recast the sentence.

>Good luck to pan glosa-pe ! I hope you succeed.

>John Avis
* Thanks John.  In a sane world there is a place 
for Glosa... but we aint got one.

Thank you, Robin, for your explanation.


My first thoughts were that the two sentences meant
what you said and that panto cina ami were agreeing
with the criticism in the first sentence.

It was not the "verb cluster" that threw me - what
threw me was that I could not believe that panto cina
ami could not recognise Chinese syntax in Glosa !
This made me question whether I was translating
correctly.

I suppose the answer is that while Glosa is similar to
Chinese and English, it not Chinese nor English.

I do not consider myself a glosa-pe as I have made no
attempt to learn Glosa, but with a rough idea of its
syntax I have been reading it and, as I said, most of
the time I can read it easily.

You have left me wondering whether I should make some
serious effort to learn it !

Yours, 
John Avis
