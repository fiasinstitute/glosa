Saluta Glosa-pe

I would like to ask if there is a way we might organize at least a
suggestion committee. I feel while the language is one of the best ideas
for an interlanguage that has been put forth, I still have a few ideas
about Glosa in general. I like some of the other ideas that have been
introduced as well (the imperative tense for one.)  It would be great if
we might see how some of these ideas could be tested and then shown to
Wendy. Not a governing body per se rather a suggestion box type thing.
if nothing else to start discussions.

Also I was wondering how one could get a copy of the 18 steps book. 

I am working on getting the Glosa dictionary into a flash card type
program. Once I get the words entered I could make it available if
anyoone would be interested.

Thanks!

Tom Cook
