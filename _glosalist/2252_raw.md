Do you mean, you can't remember L=
atin endings, the endings I proposed or (some) Glosa endings?

And, what is=
 the easiest? Root ending derivation rules like the ones I propose wouldn't=
 make Glosa (or Glota) any more difficult, because you don't need to learn =
them (they are not productive as in Esperanto). You just need to know that =
"hand" is "manu" and not "mani" (as in "manipulate"), and that "nati" is "b=
irth" and that "natio" is "nation" and not the other way round. That is the=
 same "easiest" as before, isn't it? Glosa words like "manu", "nati" and "n=
atio" are the same in Glota (my dialect). But they do follow root ending de=
rivation rules, which shows that Glosa could have had them, too, and in som=
e cases even gives the impression of having them.

Regards,
Stephan
