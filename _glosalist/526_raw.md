dear robin
I am very interested in your ideas on glosa's syntax etc, it seems to me that 
we ought to do more on it as several people who have shown an interst in G 
have commented on the rather l;oose way the structure has been dealt with or 
avoided and have drifted away. more of your ideas would be welcome .
here are afew ideas I've been mulling over 
1) "(slowly) the black dogs with long tails ate the new food (slowly)
subject phrase= particle (the) simple modifier (black) head noun complex prep 
modifier
verb phrase no particle, past tense is enough  the modifiers are at the 
beginning or the end of the sentence
good english but not really good for an ial
2) the black with long tails dogs did slowly eat the new food'
head word final, end of phrase clear by particles "the" and "did"
better, more regular , ial but curious english
but :- those black with long tail dog eat slowness the ........  
plu melani ko longi kaudi kani vora u .......
not very clear glosa
3) the dogs, black with tails long  did eat slow the food new.
plu kani , melani ko plu kaudi longi pa vora lentu u fago nova
here, we know exactly where to find the head word - it is second in the 
phrase after the particle.
this word order, I think,  would make glosa clearer 
I may be out of touch a little in the next 3 or 4 weeks - out in the wild 
......
