I've just thought about it.
Wh=
at about automatic translation Glosa <-> Esperanto?
It seems to me the resu=
lt would be more acceptable, then
when we have to deal with national uneasy=
 languages.

Say me true, why you are not speak or write Esperanto?
Is ther=
e something ugly in it?

If you know Glosa, why not Esperanto? The way is s=
hot.
