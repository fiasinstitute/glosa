Hi everybody, sorry for the long post, hope that some of you proceed to
the end :) (skip parts ;) )

A Glosa with english words doesn't feel like a good idea for me, if it
were intended as an auxlang. While I was looking for a different auxlang
after trying esperanto, I also came across Basic English, and it seems
that the critics go along the lines that
1) as a simplified natural language, it may sound very stupid to native
speakers of the original (and worse, the _speakers_ of the simplified
language may sound stupid to them)
2) as a simplified natural language, it may actually be hard for native
speakers to use it
3) it can be seen (and by some people will be seen / is seen) as one
further, obfuscated step to make english itself the world language.
While you could argue that point 3 is no longer relevant, because
english has in fact become the world language, I still think it's not a
good choice to use a single living language as the basis for an
international language.
For all who don't know the book: I read 'Homens contra babel' of Paulo
Rï¿½onai (english title might be something like 'Battle against Babel',
but I don't know). It is quite old (~1969) so Klingon is not included
;), but I found it very informative and entertaining (and it was
available at my local public library :) )

Some things came to my mind when I tried esperanto:
I began to learn it from the free programs/websites they provide, and
played around with it for a couple of weeks.
My experiences are: Grammar is still not so easy, words are transforming
a lot with different roles. I found the 'ki-/-el','ti-/-u' etc _very_
hard to memorize (took me longer than memorizing 40 of the 'normal'
words...), and the same was the case with most of the _lots of_ post-and
prefixes. With some of them, I also had difficulties to find out the
subtle differences between two or three of them. I found the glosa
postfixes much easier to remember, and, I currently think, the limited
number of them is much to Glosa's advantage. Adding to the list should
be done very carefully, if at all...
I then tried to read a few threads in discussion forums in Esperanto,
and found it _very_ hard to understand them with help of a
dictionary(-program). First of all, because words change a lot, it is
sometimes hard to find the word(-stem) at all. Second, I found the
so-much-celebrated flexibility in structuring the sentence
(object-verb-subject, whatever) getting in my way. It seems to me that,
because "the structure is clear because I mark objects, verbs and
subjects with different endings", people begin to construct sentences 2
kilometers long, mixing different ways of structuring their sentence.
Often, it was very hard for me to find out which object belonged to
which verb/subject, or perhaps the object of one part of the sentence
was suddenly the subject of another part? I can't tell. Probably they
did it the way they were used from they mother language, and this
flexibility is great. But it comes to the cost that every 'receiver' of
'messages' in Esperanto has to adapt to the special way the 'sender'
structures the message, and that might be very different from what you
are used to, and, more importantly, you might have absolutely no idea
about it. E.g. I'm told that hungarian is very special and complicated,
and clearly Esperanto sometimes comes with hungarian 'flavor'.
I know that glosa doesn't prevent you from forming too complicated
sentences, but at least it gets rid of the complexity of changing words
according to their role, that doesn't help to prevent the problem anyway.

I think, the language of the future must be easily processable by a
computer, and with Glosa I find this a very big advantage. Glosa could
and probably should be further refined in this direction. If you could
truthfully say 'download this small program and be able to read and
write texts in Glosa', well, that would be a thing to mention ;)

Saluta, Eike
