Karo Miller
I fully agree with style of using a language-it is like a pen, =
a child
scribbles, Da vinci draws inventions, shakespeare writesgreat  play=
s; it is a tool with a style!
I hope adding 20 words to grammar(impossible =
:-)):
1- using pronouns other than fe,an(used also as suffixes); il=3Dhe, e=
la-she etc
2- using articles for posession: il da eko=3D his car( or other =
than da)
3- using articles for adjecives or present pariciple(why ge- is us=
ed agreably  for past participle), optional(interese, difere; are okay): la=
krima na babi: crying baby

4- using articles for ordinals instead of putti=
ng number after name:
mon sa, bi sa(first, second) or other than "sa"!

---=
-
these will never change the  isolating feature; simple and few,they'd giv=
e clarity and power! Alas impossible!
