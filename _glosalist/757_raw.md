The rules I mentioned were of Interglossa, not Glosa. I do not know 
whether Glosa has inherited them.
Interglossa seems to have used an initial capital letter for the head 
word in verb phrases as well. The rule is on page 39 of Hogben's book 
which you can access from the Glosa website. Find 'external links' - 
'William Patterson' and  on that line you will find a link to 
Interglossa book.

Saluta,
John Avis
