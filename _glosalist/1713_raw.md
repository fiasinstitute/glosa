Kara Glosa-pe--

A verb that is transitive in one language is very often intransitive in
another language.  Because of this, the rule in Glosa is simply:  If the
verb takes an object, it is transitive; if it doesn't take an object, it
is intransitive.

People from most different languages tend to say:
Mi cerka mi oku lenti.

In English the verb for CERKA is intransitive, so an English speaker
would be more likely to say:
Mi cerka de mi oku lenti.  [I'm looking FOR my glasses.]

There is no important difference in the meanings.

And one more thing:  If I say:
Mu pa sti kine.

Is KINE here a noun or a verb?  Who can say for sure?  But the meaning is
the same either way.

Sorry I haven't been able to write much lately.  My mother- and
father-in-law have been in-and-out of the hospital lately with heart
problems, and my own father just died of cancer.

Keep up the good work!
-> Dura vi boni ergo!

Saluta,
