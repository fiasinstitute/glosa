I hope I did not do too badly with the subject line.

How many long texts e=
xist in Glosa?

In 1910 Kearney translated La Aventuroj de Alicio en Mirlan=
do, and in 1996 Donald Broadribb published his translation. I republished t=
he Kearney translation in 2009.

At present Ralph Midgley is translating Al=
ice into both Volap=FCk and Neo, a paragraph per day each. He's been at it =
since September 2010 or a bit before and is about 75% done the Volap=FCk tr=
anslation.

I know of one chapter of Through the Looking-Glass and a poem o=
r two in Interlingua (dating to the 1960s), but nothing else. Now, Interlin=
gua is pretty robust, and I'm expecting that when "Vent=FCrs jiela L=E4lid =
in Stunal=E4n" and "Los Aventuros de Alis in Marvoland" appear in 2011 or e=
arly 2012 that we will see someone take up work on an Interlingua Alice. En=
vy, perhaps. At least I hope so.

Will we see a Glosa translation? To put i=
t another way... is Glosa mature enough for a 27,000 word novel?
