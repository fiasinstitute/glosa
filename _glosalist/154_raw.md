**  ge-dice ex Beti     OR   Beti dice, "...," tem klude plu tri porta.
    [said by Betty]        [Betty says, "...," while closing the three doors.]
                             S     V      O     Supplementary Clause

  However, I feel Sid's original sentence was in better style. (more poetic)

   "Qe, tu pa ge-nati in un agri?" dice Beti tem klude plu tri porta.
   ["Were you born in a field?"   says Betty while closing the three doors. 
              O                    V     S     Supplementary Clause


  This is a form of the Passive Voice (O-V-S), but is allowable in creative
writing: Past Tense is given by earlier context; and the meaning is quite
clear, when the more correct Passive Voice form, ~gene ge-dice ex Beti~ is
elide to ~dice Beti~.

Saluta,

  P.S. Although Glosa is designed to be ultra-logical, in Creative Writing,
if logic gets in the way of poetry, and if meaning is not compromised by
the poetry, then poetry wins.    R.G.
