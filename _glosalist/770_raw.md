Hello Glosa-pe
I've started a Glosa defining dictionary at the wiki site:

=
http://glosalist.pbwiki.com/Plu%20verba%20te%20defini

Everyone is welcome =
to add to it or make corrections until it is
finished. It is one way to fig=
ure out what words should be taught
first from the core to new learners. Be=
ginning reader books can use
this as the base vocabulary to build on for te=
aching the remaining
core words.

It also helps economize the creation of G=
losa learning material as
less work will be necessary to train a person fro=
m their native
language to Glosa as half the work will be done only once in=
 Glosa.
I've added the first definition today. I will try to add one every =
few
days or so.
