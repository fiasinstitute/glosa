So far, I have split the long sentence into short ones:- "When, as a small 
child, she was sent to fetch something from the sitting-roonm, she would open 
the door slowly, peering fearfully at the hearth". ->
"susan was a small child."
"susan dd gt send  to th sitting-room . "
"she wd (would) slow open th door"
"she dd peering at th fire-place . "
the author started with a short swntence and followed with the long complex 
one for much contrast. if it can be done in english, it can also be done in 
glosa!
"tem u susana pa es u pusi infanta e tem fe pa gene bali a u sedi-kamera te 
aporta uno-ra , fe sio lento aperi u porta e fe pa stare, ko u fobo, a u 
piro-lo . "
