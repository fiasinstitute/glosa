Hello Patrick,

Thanks for your attentive reading of pan-glosa.

OK, so me I prefer the third, but in my idea, it is important that 
one use=
 pan-glosa as he feel, and the three forms are good. 

Therefore I continue=
d thinking about that, and during a month I 
traveled in Spain, without int=
ernet connexion, so the ultimate 
changes are not yet on line. For example,=
 the appartenance-marker 
"de" need to be compounded with -co or -ce:
X de-=
co Y =3D (english) X's Y 
X de-ci Y =3D (english) X of Y


Naturelly, I am =
not sure that all the reforms I propose may be 
keeped, but I know that Glo=
sa need some grammatical change.

Daniel.
