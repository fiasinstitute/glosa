Hello,
Mi gene sko de Glosa, but I have already encountered difficulties / questions:
"plu" seems to mean both "the" (plural), "the" (cathegory) and "the" (group).

I like singers
I like the singers
I like the choir

plu kanta-pe

Btw, is the stress in "kanta-pe" on the first or the second "a"?

Gratia,
Stefo
