I find that "plu" is used as a literal translation of "-s" (plural). 
When =
I was learning English eons ago :-) I used to wonder, "What is 
this Wester=
n obsession with singular and plural?" As I began to 
speak I gradually for=
got about it. 
 
I believe that in most naturally isolating languages where=
 a noun is 
usually translated as singular, actually contains plural meanin=
g as 
well. They do not normally use "plu" equivalent particle, except 
whe=
n they want to stress it. I noticed some instances of this in 
Glosa as wel=
l. E.g. mo bibli (one book), tri bibli (three books); u 
flori (a flower), =
poli flori (many flowers). In these examples the 
"noun" (without -s or plu=
) seems to be singular as well as plural. 
 
I recommend you would adopt th=
is feature in Glosa; i.e. a word 
(noun) would be both singular and plural;=
 therefore, "plu" (when 
otherwise required) is not needed unless you would=
 like to emphasize 
on the fact it is plural. (Similar methods are used in =
Glosa; e.g. 
"u" is both definite and indefinite articles) It would make th=
e 
language a little simpler, would it not?
