Hi!

I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. I decided to learn Glosa, so I asked=
 to be accepted as a member of the glosalist. Of course for the next weeks =
I'll only read the messages, at least untill I can write without making man=
y mistakes.
I want to but soem publication from The Glosa Education Organiz=
ation, but I have some questions concerning the shipping costs... may you s=
end me their e-mail direction?
I am sure I'll have a lot to learn and share=
 with you all.

My best regards!
