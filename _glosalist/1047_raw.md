Hi,

First, I apologize for my unskilful active use of English. I am going =
to do my best. Sorry, I 
cannot use Glosa yet :-)

But, I am a former user =
of esperanto. I gave up esperanto for some ideological, personal and 
techn=
ical reasons... Glosa seems to me much more interesting as an auxiliary lan=
gage for 
humanity. What was the Hogben's opinion about esperanto ?

What i=
s your opinion about Chomsky's declaration that esperanto (as any other con=
structed 
language) is not a language ? It seems that the text of the inter=
view with Chomsky is no more 
available on the web, but any of you who woul=
d like a PDF copy, can ask to me.
