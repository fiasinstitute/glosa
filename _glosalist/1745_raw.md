Ian--
 
You're doing great in Glosa! You must be getting close to fluent.
 
A couple notes on "Agri-pe e Cikonia":
 
ASPERGE is a fine Glosa word, but IF you want to keep the vocabulary
smaller, "an nu-pa asperge per plu sperma" could be translated "an nu-pa
bali plu sperma peri agri."
 
RUPTI means "break" as a "15 minute break at work." FRAKTI would be
better here.
 
It has been a long time since anyone used the Glosa Wiki, but perhaps you
could contact Marcel, marcel@..., and get the password from him,
and add some of your translations to it.
 
Saluta,
_ _
