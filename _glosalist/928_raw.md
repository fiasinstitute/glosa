"I had some contact with hindi some time ago and am thinking of how
glosa c=
ould use hindi word order -verb final, also some slight contact
with welsh =
verb first"

I think that it could be easy to make Glosa a few independant =
of the
word order. It need only two particules :
- one to mark the object o=
f a verb
- one to mark the present mode of a verb.

Try "i" for the object =
mark and "to" [:-)] for the mark of the present
mode.
You can now write thi=
s Glosa clause "an frakti u botilia" by different
ways.
(an) (TO frakti) ("=
I" u botilia)
(TO frakti) (an) (I u botilia)
(an)(I botilia) (TO frakti) 
{=
note that AN is the subject, if it is a reflexive pronoun you have to
write=
 "I an" : [(botilia) (to frakti) (I AN)] }
(I u botilia) (TO frakti) (an)
A=
nd so on : 
(I u botilia) (PA frakti) (an)
(I u botilia) (FU frakti) (an)
(=
I u botilia) (NU FU frakti) (an)
(I u botilia) (NU DU PA frakti) (an)
(I u =
botilia) (DU TO frakti) (an)

I think it may not allways necessary to mark =
the object when the order
SVO is the respected rule. The language IDO use a=
 seeming system for
the "accusative", special end of word or particule befo=
re give the
same logical meaning.
