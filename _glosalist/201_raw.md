**  Very kind.  I am in a financial mess, and need to economise: I had two
websites and now will have none.  Will, when I settle down in Lithgow, set
up a commercial site offering my services as an editor.

them.  Or maybe wrap a museumy frame around the whole thing.

**  Zeta was bought out by Pacific Internet from Singapore.  The Zeta
address is no more.  I will still be operating the Pacific address, but
must concentrate energies on working up the editing as a retirement
enterprise.  Had I planned my life better, this abrupt shut down would not
have happened.
    I still think Glosa is suitable as the IAL, but know that Esperanto has
the organisation.  With all of the recent attacks on traditional diplomacy,
the idea of a World Nuspeak seems even further away than it did in 1992.

Saluta,
