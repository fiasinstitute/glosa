Here is my solution to military ranks:

Private =3D SIMPLI MILITA-PE (This =
is how it is said in several other languages)
Corporal =3D DU-STRIA CEFA
Se=
rgeant =3D TRI-STRIA CEFA

"Lieutenant" is already in the GID as LOKOTENENT=
E, but this word is
borrowed from Interlingua. I have simplified it to LOKA=
-TENA-PE, but
now I tend to use VICE-KAPITANA or SUB-KAPITANA.

Captain =3D=
 KAPITANA
Major =3D SUPRA-KAPITANA

"Colonel" comes from French and means "=
the head of a column (regiment)."

Colonel =3D ARME-MERO CEFA
General =3D G=
ENERALI (ARME CEFA)

Some countries have systems that contain terms such as=
 "first captain"
and "second captain." If you're a Romulan (from Star Trek)=
, you have
"commanders" and "subcommanders." No system will work perfectly =
for
every country.
