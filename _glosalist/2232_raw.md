Dear Gary and dear Glosa-people,

I can see you point, which was my problem=
 with Glosa in the first place. Arbitrary endings are not an option for me,=
 I find them too hard to memorize. On the other hand, it is difficult to ch=
ose a meaning for a root like "stat" for instance: It could mean anything f=
rom "stand", "station", "state", "status" including their different meaning=
s. Which is why I came up with forms like "stati", "statio", "statione", "s=
tatu", "statura", "stato", "status" based on Latin (Interlingua). Glosa doe=
s something similar with "nati" (birth) and "natio" (nation). I have made s=
imilar modifications to greek words with regular formations of "grafi", "gr=
afia", "grafa", "grafe", "grafo".

This is why a made my own dialect of Glo=
sa - "Glota", which you can find here:

lotalist/

You're all invited. :)

Thank you very much for your answers.

R=
egards,
Stephan
