Is there a list of only the official Centra Glosa words? I know there are l=
ists that have these words within but I am not wild about digging through t=
hem to find these words. Could we come up with a recommended set of word to=
 use? to teach? I am working on spreading the word but there are a lot of d=
ictionaries out there...

Thanks,

Tom
