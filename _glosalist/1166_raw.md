Hello Master 1077
  It is true that there has been very little activity on the Glosalist recently but I think that the language lives on if only because it is probably the best of all auxiliary languages.
  My last contact with Wendy Ashby was in February of this year when she was recovering from a serious illness and as far as I am aware there is no committee or organisation that is promoting the language at present.   Hopefully the time will come when some Glosa enthusiasts will form an association to carry the language forward.
   With regards,   David.
