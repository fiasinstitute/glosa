Greetings+ACE-  Saluta+ACE-

Pardon that I write only in English this time, but I am rushed.  I have a
suggestion.

+AD4- The book +AF8-18 Steps+AF8- is available for 8.95 pounds Sterling plus .75
+AD4- shipping (about 14 US dollars)....   If you call your
+AD4- local banks or try the Internet yourself, perhaps you can find a better
+AD4- deal.

One thing that you can do that has worked for me in sending money to the UK
(to Wendy, in fact) is to go to a commercial bank and buy English money,
that is, 5-, 10- or 20-pound notes.  You can then send the GBP 10 to Wendy
in a letter, which is by far the easiest way to do this.  I usually keep
about GBP 20-30 on hand for just this purpose.  You pay for the notes at the
commercial rate of the day, but it is much better than spending money for
huge bank charges, and you don't have to invest a large amount.  I have
never lost money in transit this way, but of course the risk is there.
