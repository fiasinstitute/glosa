Uploaded a new version t=
hat loads the dictionary file into memory on
start-up, which means that it =
is slower on start-up for the
command-line mode, but a couple of orders of =
magnitude faster in
translation.   In addition the following improvements h=
ave been made:

1. Plurals for physician, mathematician, etc. recognized.
2=
. Fancied distinguished from fancies, worried from worries, etc.
3. Recogni=
zes the 'ize' ending: memorize, memorizes, memorized,
memorizing, all disti=
nguished.

I've also uploaded the source code to my website at
http://www.c=
ostarricense.cr/pagina/ernobe/gishicn.txt but it appears
that the administr=
ators are out or something: it's not getting
updated.  Maybe tomorrow.
