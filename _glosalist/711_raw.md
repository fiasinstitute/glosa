Hi Vasiliy,

I agree. It is a big project. Creating the software can be done by one 
person and some time, a few months to a year. Making nicely polished 
software would take longer. Marketing would cost a lot too. There are 
several companies that are international that could be approached such 
as Coca-Cola. This would be a great mutually beneficial advertising 
campaign for them.

There is also the open-source route which is the route that the Linux OS 
took. One person starts it. A few more hop on board. A small loyal user 
base grows by word of mouth and after a few years the thing takes off.

Regards,
Bill
