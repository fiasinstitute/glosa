I am hoping there is going to be more activity on the list. I think 
that G=
losa has by far the best ideas concerning a world second 
language. It need=
s only to get its name and purpose out there. I have 
dabbled in the study =
of languages for far longer that I care to 
admit, and here I have found al=
l of the concepts in place that I feel 
will make the interlangage (not a r=
eal word...I know) a very definite 
possibility.

That isn't to say that I =
haven't found a couple things I'd change, 
because I have. (is my grammar a=
s bad as it seems? that jsut read as 
an ugly sentence)  All in all, it is =
the best solution to something 
which has been a problem for too long.

I h=
ope that these discussions pick up soon and I hope to be able to 
add somet=
hing to them. I also hope that my abilities improve enough 
to where I can =
speak in Glosa soon as well.

Plu Saluta,


Hal
