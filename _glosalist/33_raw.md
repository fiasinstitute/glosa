And I thank you for this. I appreciate your
honesty and it's time to move on. Agreed?

Not quite okay. I don't "hate" Charles.
I hate his use of vulgarity and his insults
against folks on this list. Not just me. If
anyone else exhibited this kind of behavior
I'd voice my complaint against them also.
I feel that there was no need of it on this
list.

I guess a lot depends on Robin... He is the
administrator of this list. I suggest he reform
the list. By this I suggest that he move the
group over to something like Yahoo!Groups
and automatically put all members now on
Zeta on to Yahoo... and if anyone wants to
they can unsubscribe a lot easier than from 
Zeta.org.au
 
Since,
Jay B.
