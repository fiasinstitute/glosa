Karo pe; qi es ci a-nu,

Because of the spam and virus attacks in glosalist, I tried to learn
more about mailing lists the last days.  Here some lines about it:

The EZMLM-program, that runs glosalist@...,
(manual: www.ezmlm.org/ezman-0.32/ ) is available in two versions: the
simple EZMLM and the more functional EZMLM-IDX, which allows
moderating.  That would be the easiest solution for us, if the
list-owner (Robin) would moderate glosalist or if he would set in a
co-moderator.  (I just sent this letter also to Robin and to
glosalist-owner@... ).


Another thing: I tested 3 mailing-list providers:
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist , glosalist@yahoogroups.com
  http://uk.domeus.com , "glosa-forum",     glosa-forum@...
  http://www.kbx7.de , "glosa-forum",       glosa-forum@...

If you feel like it, you can play with them: subscribe, send a test
mail, receive it again and unsubscribe.  These groups are not
moderated yet, but all of them offer the possibility to do so.  My
impression: yahoo is the best of them (switch the option "Do not
convert to HTML"!).  Two things I dislike:

 * I tried to forward the messages of the old glosalist@...
   into these new forums, but that does not work.  All of them filter
   the EZMLM-postings out.  That is sad, because when we would change
   over to a new provider, the Glosa community would be splitted.
   Some will remain in the old system, some will leave Glosa
   completely.

 * The old glosalist@... is advert free - though it is attacked
   by viruses and spam mails.  The companys above allow to moderate
   and to sort out the bad mails, but they get their money from
   adverts attached to the mails, what we would have to accept then.

Other possibilities:
www.yourmailinglistprovider.com , advert free, but only one mail per
  day, or more mails per day and then 2.50 EURO/month.
www.jpberlin.de , a "political provider", perhaps not expensive,
  on vacations at the moment.
www.listserv.dfn.de free and no adverts, but only for scientist who are
  member of DFN.
Some universities, ... but only when you are student or staff there.


I think, the situation in glosalist@... is not acceptable any
longer and we have to act.  I would say: change over to yahoo is better
than staying here.  Please tell me, what your opinion is.

Nuli-tem despera, saluta

Marcel
