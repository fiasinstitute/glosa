Dear Ricky,
I would say that a solution like LFN's is well possible in Glos=
a: 'U mi desira es forti,' 'My desire is strong,'=C2=A0since the Glosa arti=
cle u(n) has usually the function of ambiguity solver.

Xavi.

[glosalist] Question from new learner
 

=C2=A0 
I have recently come acros=
s this language and have started studying it. So far, I really like it. But=
 I have a question. If I say or write 'Mi desira es forti' does this mean '=
I desire to be strong' or 'My desire is strong'?  If it can mean either, yo=
u need a way to determine which it means. 

LFN, like Glosa, does not use w=
ord endings to determine part of speech and 'me' and 'my' are identical. Wh=
en the meaning is ambiguous they solve the problem by putting la 'the' in f=
ront of me, 'La me desira es forte.' Which means 'my desire is strong' whil=
e 'Me desira es forte' would mean 'I desire to be strong.'  I don't really =
like this solution but it is a solution. Does Glosa have a way to deal with=
 this?
