I agree with Eike. As I have said before in a spoken
situation, clarity is very important. In all the languages
I know the tens and hundreds and so on are all there.  If
the language is to be understandable and 'the language you
already know' the number system should include those
magnitude words. 

and to change the subject, which of the lists is the
definitive Glosa word list?  There are more than one or two
out there, which is the one everyone uses?

And is there a different word for love?  i think the way
like and love are used to talk about an activity are a
little confusing.  'I like cooking' or 'I love cooking', in
Glosa are the same ( i think) 'Mi amo kuko'.  To me the are
different levels of enjoyment.  I think it would be more
easily understood as 'I enjoy cooking'. To use love this
way seems (to me) to be an english (american) way to say
that.

And is this the word for the emotion of love? Mi amo tu. or
is there another?


And I think I will sign of now...

Saluta,
Tom
