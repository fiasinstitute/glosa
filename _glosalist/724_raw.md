Plu Amika,
Very briefly, Lojban is a copyrighted version of Loglan (a 'logical' 
'language') made up on the a-priori pattern.  Loglan was created by 
computer programmers to carry programming-type syntax.  Lojban was a 
continuation of this theme by other programmers.
It is very intellectual, i.e. the opposite of the a-posteri more 
natural, synthesised  languages that follow the patterns of existing, 
national languages: Glosa and Esperanto are examples of these.

While I looked at lojban, and tried to follow its rationale, I got 
tired of the wranglings and court-cases over who "owned" it.  I guess 
I was not impressed with the whole idea of an intellectually imposed 
logicality.

By contrast, Glosa has a logicality that is not intellectual, but 
which comes from the 'hard-wired' syntactical structures of the 
brain.  Needless to say, these have not been written down... yet.

Saluta,

Robin
