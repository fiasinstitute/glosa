.eng.html

Soon after that page was current, I renamed Glo to Tavo, then sw=
itched
it from Greek roots to Latin, then adopted LFN's vocabulary, and
eve=
ntually decided that a pure subset of LFN was "good enough". I
haven't done=
 anything with Glo/Tavo for years now.

Looking back, I now believe that Gl=
osa is closer to my ideal than LFN,
and if the few serious flaws in Glosa c=
ould be fixed (syntax and
vocabulary), I would be really happy.
