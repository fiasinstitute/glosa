U-CI POSTA ES MI OPINE SOLO.

I believe that there is a problem with the way Glosa is taught. It might just be me, but a knocked down version of 18 Steps is not enough. I feel that we need a better means of instruction in order to serve the need for instruction for those who do not have the patience or the capability to learn Glosa by deconstucting sentences. 

I also believe that the full version of 18 Steps should be made accessible to those who wish to learn Glosa this way. It will also be a great supplement to the online lessons.
