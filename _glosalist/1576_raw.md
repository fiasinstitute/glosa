i have personnaly studied lojban, and i find it to be a very bad choice for=
 an auxlang, mostly because of its grammar. i also never like the phonology=
 since it allows alot of bizarre consonant clusters.

it is astoundingly al=
ien and takes up way too much memory to learn. there is no language on this=
 planet that relies solely on word order like lojban does to differentiate =
gramatical case. the only cases where you see this, this is only used for t=
he nominative and maybe the direct object (as in english).

however, there =
is something similar you can do that can infact work, it was something i to=
yed with while working on my own auxlang. it is a concept called 'coverbs' =
that do exist in alot of languages. let me give an example:

let's say we h=
ad two sentences:

i am going to my home
and

i am going from the store

in=
 a language that used coverbs, there would be no prepostion here. instead e=
ach would use a seperate verb. so these sentences would look something like=
:

i go-to home
i go-from store

here's the interesting part: if we wanted =
to say the sentence "I am going to my home from the store", we simple combi=
ne the two sentences together like so:

i go-to home go-from store.

i beli=
eve chinese does this, so maybe the chinese guy where-ever he is could deta=
il it more.
