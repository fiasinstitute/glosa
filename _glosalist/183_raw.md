**  Elision is not dialect, nor is it sloppy language.

    Glosa words, in a section of elided Glosa text, are still the same
Glosa words that we would read, or hear, in the verbose version of the
utterance.

    Simply,   ~An pa ki ad an domi.~  is the verbose, or full, version, and
 ~An pa ki domi.~  or  ~An ki domi.~  are two elided versions of the same
message.

    Words are left out, it is not that letters are left off words.

    I'd say the use of elision is something we learn by listening - as
children.

    In Glosa, however, we need to agree on the conventions that will give
elided language the same meaning within different cultures.

    It would be wrong for English speakers to attempt to impose the elision
formulae for English onto the rest of the world.

    In the same way that there probably is a 'natural' syntax, which Glosa
ought to follow, there should also be a 'natural' formula for eliding
language, and that would be the best pattern for use within Glosa.

Saluta,
