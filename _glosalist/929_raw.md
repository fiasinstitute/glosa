Hi all,
I still don't like the idea of a flexible word order, it's one of the  
things that I really don't like in Esperanto.
Since this was already discussed on this list, I'll refer to my two  
cents given in
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist/message/691
and
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist/message/813

In these posts I explain why I would like both for glosa:
a) a (present mode / neutral) verb marker, because it makes the  
sentence structure more obvious
b) a clearer and even stricter defined word order, where I don't  
really care whether it is SVO, VSO, SOV or whatever of the 6  
combinations, as long as it will be only one of them

:))
