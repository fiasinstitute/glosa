It's available at http:/=
/ar.geocities.com/ernobe/gish.zip  Just a few
minutes ago I uploaded a newe=
r version with the following improvements:

1.  Improved spacing of non-let=
ter characters.  
2.  Now recognizes words like continual, currency, donati=
on, and
traditionally.  
3.  Cleaned up the dictionary.  Removed words that=
 are not referenced
anyway.
4.  Decided on a name, Gish, short for Glosa en=
glISH or Glosified
englISH as you prefer.
