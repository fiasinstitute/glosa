Hi, Richard and Gary, welcome to the new glosalist at Yahoo!!!

I just have subscribed you both. 

Please make soon a Yahoo-profile and get an access to the group's
website http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist .  Information 
about that is in the e-mail, that has been sent to you personally. 

Then you can change your settings to "Do not convert to HTML", what
is recommended.  With that option you will get much fewer advertising
stuff from Yahoo.  Unfortunately I -- as list-owner -- cannot make
this setting for you, sorry. 

Greetings and saluta

Marcel
