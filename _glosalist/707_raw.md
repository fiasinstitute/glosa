Does anyone know of a set of tapes or CDs simmilar to the "All-Audio" 
seri=
es for Glosa?

The "All-Audio" series focuses on learning speech, and not t=
he written 
form of a language.

It seems that this form of learning would =
be greatly benificial to a 
completely phonetic language such as Glosa.
