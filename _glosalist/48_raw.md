Dear Mr. Queener,

I am sorry it took so long to answer your letter.  I put in a new
computer and the Internet connection is not working properly.  I don't
seem to have a current e-address for you, so I'll try to contact you this
way.

In answer to your questions:  The original Interglossa book by Lancelot
Hogben is out of print.  I hear it had only a small dictionary of 800
words.  The best English-to-Glosa dictionary in print is found in the
back of _Central Glosa_, available from:

Glosa
PO Box 18
Richmond
Surrey TW9 2GE
ENGLAND

I believe the current price is 9.95 pounds sterling plus .95 shipping. 
An international money order is necessary.

The Glosa newsletter, _Plu Glosa Nota_, is also available from the above
address for 11.50 pounds by airmail or 8.00 pounds by sea.

You can get the best dictionary from the Internet at www.glosa.org.  The
".pdf" version will read just like a book if you print it out.  The
dictionary is 120 pages long, so make sure you have an extra ink
cartridge ready.  It is free, thanks to Marcel in Germany, who loves
Glosa.

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, I can easily arrange Marcel's
dictionaries into a Microsoft Word document that should print normally on
your computer and send it to you by e-mail, if you give me your current
e-mail address.  And if all that fails, I'll print one myself and send it
to you!

Until I get my Internet connection fixed, you will get faster results by
sending e-mail to me at justi.miller@....

Let me know if I can help in any way.

Saluta,
 _  _
  /.   Gary
