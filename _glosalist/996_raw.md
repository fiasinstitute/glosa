  I think that in Glosa, except any words such "de, to, e, sed ..." all
  the overs are concept-words. I want to say that they can, potentialy,
  be use as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, if the writer can give them
  some sense.
  Naturely, we need a mark for indicate if a phrase is a noun-phrase or
  a verb-phrase. I advance GO for active-verb and to use GE for
  status-verb (=adjective, as in indonesian language ).

  Daniel
