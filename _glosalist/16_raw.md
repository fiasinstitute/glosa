Ok, hmmm. Everyone is agreed that the present glosalist is no good at all.
But any change must be regarded in terms of what is lost and what is gained.

Personally, I think a change to a Yahoo! group is an excellent idea. What we
lose is the discussion list where we can send an email to all members on the
mailing list. But what we gain is a discussion group with web-based
discussions (although Yahoo! provides members with the ability to receive
discussions by email and [I think] to post messages by email. Also what we
gain is the ability to promote the group to Internet users and possibly to
bring in new members.

I think it should be done, and fast, because my anti-virus program is on
overdrive at the moment!

But, just a thought, let's consider those amongst us (me) who are fledgling
Glosa speakers and not yet confident to post in un Glosa lingua. So let's
allow English in the new group.

Anthony
