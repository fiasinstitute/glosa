Hello Jordon,

I've done this for the Glosa Central to English direction for a program 
called Fullrecall. The link to my file is: 
http://www.thebranchhearth.net/glosa/gls_ad_en_core.fr

It is xml format. You can run it through sed or similar program a few 
times to format it to the Supermemo format as well as reverse the 
direction. That's what I used to transfer from the glosa web page to 
xml. If you're familiar with sed, it should probably take 10 minutes to 
an hour.

Regards,
Bill
