***  Laslo, as a line of discussion, I suggest that this is the right place 
to include the one, or two, last messages that precede it.

So, I do recall adding a comment to this thread.
Perhaps Igor did not wish to say too much, simply because the suggestions 
for directly joining affixes to Glosa substantive words goes against the 
whole foundation on which the language was built.

      There is NO AGREEMENT in Glosa  EG   they run   he runs      ~mu 
kursi~   ~an kursi~
      Likewise  ... "words do not change for reasons of 
grammar."   EG  run      ~(nu) kursi~
      ---> Here I quote Ron Clark word for 
word.                                     ran      ~ pa kursi~
      Also, particles are not joined directly onto substantive words, they 
might be hyphenated, but in writing this is seen, and in speech each word 
maintains its integrity and is separately pronounced.
               EG    is moved       ~es ge-moti~
                     (not move-ed)     (not ~gemoti~)
     <And for the Computer doing a spot of "machine handling of language", 
the hyphen is a handy, and easily programable, marker; the computer does 
not have to interpret inflections, nor decide
  where the join is, so that it can decide at which point to separate the 
parts of a 'compounded' word.>
       As well as avoiding forcing words into a standardised format, 
although that might be what Laslo would prefer to have, not using vowels as 
Part-of-Speech markers also avoids possible etymological mismatching and 
the formation of some unpleasant-sounding words.

       This may not be what Igor did not say, but it is more of what I 
would say in answer to suggestions for the use of some agglutination in Glosa.

Saluta,

Robin
