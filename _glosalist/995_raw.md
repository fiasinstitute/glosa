I think that in Glosa, except any words such "de, to, e, sed ..." all=

the overs are concept-words. I want to say that they can, potentialy,
be u=
se as noun, verb, adverb, adjective, if the writer can give them
some sense=
.
Naturely, we need a mark for indicate if a phrase is a noun-phrase or
a v=
erb-phrase. I advance GO for active-verb and to use GE for
status-verb (=3D=
adjective, as in indonesian language ).
