I agree, partly. English=
 has one of the simpler structures, and is
widely known, so it is worth usi=
ng as a model in some ways. However,
Glosa-pe often write Glosa that is rea=
lly English but with Glosa
words, and the result can be very difficult to u=
nderstand.

I'm not sure I agree.

I think I l=
ike the rigid SVO order of Glosa. Is there a strong reason
to allow other p=
atterns? SVO seems simple. As long as there is a clear
marker between S and=
 V, and another between V and O, it is easy to
understand. I think allowing=
 other orders would make it harder to read.

Your English is fine. I apologize for using English here.
