I have recently come across this language and have started studying it. So =
far, I really like it. But I have a question. If I say or write 'Mi desira =
es forti' does this mean 'I desire to be strong' or 'My desire is strong'? =
 If it can mean either, you need a way to determine which it means. 

LFN, =
like Glosa, does not use word endings to determine part of speech and 'me' =
and 'my' are identical. When the meaning is ambiguous they solve the proble=
m by putting la 'the' in front of me, 'La me desira es forte.' Which means =
'my desire is strong' while 'Me desira es forte' would mean 'I desire to be=
 strong.'  I don't really like this solution but it is a solution. Does Glo=
sa have a way to deal with this?
