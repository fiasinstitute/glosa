Hello Scott,
Glad you received the 18 steps ok.
The only Glosa "caretaker" that I know of is Wendy Ashby - who has been suffering from a serious illness - I don't know her 
present situation
I am not a subscriber to Facebook yet but will join now that you have created a Glosa group.
Regards,  Davidjp

  To anyone interested, i created a facebook group for Glosa. I am also working on a Glosa wikibook for wikipedia. Any suggestions and aid you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I just hope we all can promote Glosa so that it may be used more frequently.

  Gratia,

  Scott.

  P.S. Does anyone know of the status of Glosa's caretakers?
