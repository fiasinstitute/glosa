You are right, the only kin=
d of sentence that could come up is a phrase that has a fairly very high st=
andards.

The results we will have to measure by some aspects:
How the phra=
se
- will have kept it's original message
- will have kept it's original st=
ile
- will have kept it's original flavour
In other words, we will have to =
analyse them by theirs complex entirety.
Maybe the qualifying will be rathe=
r subjective, as all libguistc things.

The translated phrases must give th=
e same impression, effect on somebody's mind as the original one.

  I thin=
k, the phrases need not have many infrequent words, but it must have a sofi=
sticated way of expressing, and it must have at least 200 words. But it nee=
d not be excessively long.
