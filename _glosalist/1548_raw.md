David--

I have never had the chance to read the entire Interglossa book.  A
portion of it is on the Internet at the Ailanto web site.

I know of no split that occurred between Interglossa and Glosa. 
Interglossa was a dead idea until Ron Clark found the book and contacted
Hogben, who was then in a wheelchair.  About 1975 the idea for Glosa was
developed.

Besides the change to a more phonetic spelling, a few words were changed.
SU is now QI, APO is AB, APO is now a verboid, not a preposition. 
Whereas Hogben preferred the words of Greek origin, Glosa uses more words
of Latin origin.  The tendency to put -O at the end of nouns and -E at
the end of verboids is gone.  Hogben's formulas for sentence order were
replaced with the simpler SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT order, with modifiers
coming before those parts of speech.

The changes are not so different; I can understand Hogben's earlier
writings without much difficulty.

Saluta,
