I've uploaded a new version of Gish ( English - Glosa webpage
translator ) =
at ar.geocities.com/ernobe/gish.zip  The source code is
available at  www.c=
ostarricense.cr/pagina/ernobe/proglosa.htm 
The following changes have been=
 implemented:

1) Fixed the problem with the timer appearing in the command=
-line
mode.  Now it is possible to translate larger texts in the console.
2=
) All-capital-letter words now recognized.
3) Now recognizes apostrophes ( =
' ) as in he's, you're, it'll, and
I'm, translating them as an es, vi es, i=
d fu, and mi es. 
4) Cleaned up the dictionary.  The program that built it =
was not able
to avoid including some phrases that have nothing to do with G=
losa (
'acquainted with', which translated acquainted as with, 'ones own',
=
which translated ones as own, etc. ).  There may still be some of
these so =
if you find any I would like to hear about it.
5) Fixes to the 'ed' ending:=
 expressed and added now recognized.
