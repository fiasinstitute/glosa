I like what your goals are. You certainly have spent a lot of time 
with ma=
ny languages.  I've tried to construct my own 
conlang/artlang/funlang/what=
-ever-lang :-) but I'm too indecisive - 
so much so that I go crazy trying =
to settle on what pronouns to use 
for my conlang!  Ugh! 

Because of its G=
reek and Latin, Glosa is my all time favorite 
auxlang.  That's why I would=
 only tweak it by adding hyphenated 
suffixes. I would love to have a pure =
Greek conlang, but I know that 
Greek borrows from Latin, plus, duh, I remi=
nd myself, there's this 
whole little thing about using the Latin alphabet/=
script. 

There probably is a pure Greek conlang out there, but I assume it=
 
uses Greek script. I'm happy using the Latin script.  

Second to Glosa, =
I like Mondlango. It's the best revision of 
Esperanto I've seen.  The Yaho=
o Mondlango group claims that tens of 
thousands of people use Mondlango. I=
t's a lot easier than Esperanto 
and Ido. 

Oddly, my enjoyment of the Star=
 Wars Aurekbesh font lead me to 
omniglot.com, where I learned about Espera=
nto and conlangs. My 
aversion to Esperanto's diacritics (and its stupid wa=
y of pronouncing 
words like scienco) made look for easier, albeit less use=
d conlangs.  
Mondlango looks like the Esperanto that would not have lost m=
e to 
Glosa.
