I know Toki pona, a nice language, and I thinked =
at "PI" when I
imagined primitively the ZU (\) for separate two word in a c=
hain. It
is not the first language that use a same method: I think at FRATE=
R, a
brother of Glosa, which use two word-keys for precize the order in a
g=
roup. It seems, but I not yet learned it, that Logban have a similar
system=
.

Glosa is a so good base! I wish that somebody can find a elegant
system =
to solve the grammar ambiguity. Pan-glosa is just a laboratory
for trying a=
ny ways, I find my solutions rather logical, but heavy
("lourd" in french).=
