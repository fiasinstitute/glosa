Congratulations Eike,
         There should be more of it.  This looks as if you have 
employed your spare time well.  Next week, when I have more time, I 
will sharpen up my brain, and revive my DOS skills to look at 
Glosastra on my W98 computer.  I think you might have to simplify the 
instructions for some of us, who are more linguistic than cybernetic 
in our orientations.

         However, for years, I've been saying that Glosa with its 
non-inflected structure is ideal for 'the machine handling of 
language'.  And it looks like you've done it.

         Again Congratulations.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
