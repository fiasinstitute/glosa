I realize that one of the most important rule of the grammar of Glosa 
migh=
t be changed ! 
In a phrase it might be better than we consider that a word=
 DO NOT 
modify the followed word.
In fact it is, actually, the reality for=
 many words : tense markers, 
numbers, quantifiers, determinant=85
e.g. thi=
s example in Robin Gaskell seminar : 
=AB ii. Sequence in Phrases
       a)=
Noun Phrases
         Noun - Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifie=
r(s) -
 'noun'
         Marker
          EG. u   plura       tri-loba      =
 mega      alti, rubi  
flori =BB

So, I think that, perhaps, it is better =
to admit, in Pan-glosa, that 
in a group (phrase) a word modifies the last =
word (i.e the important 
word (verb or noun)), except if a mark expressely =
says that it 
modifies the word which follow it. I imagine the word ZI, whi=
ch can 
be marked by letters (Zi) or by a special punctuation (~). If it is=
 a 
punctuation, it is not already necessery to say it if the mode of 
spea=
king is clear.

e.g. u plura tri-loba mega ~ alti  rubi flori
e.g. u plura =
tri-loba mega zi alti  rubi flori


U, PLURA, TRI-LOBA, ALTI, RUBI, modify =
FLORI, 
but MEGA modifies ALTI.

I am not sure if X ~ Y can have a differen=
t meaning as X-Y.
