Karo Glosa-pe-

There seemed to be some question about word order in verb p=
hrases. I
repeat what I've said before: Understandability before
grammatica=
llity! But this is the official list of details:

1. NE

2. NU, PA, FU

3. =
SIO

4. DU

5. Adverb

6. Modal (VOLU, POTE, DEBI, NECE, HEDO...)

7. Verbo=
id or verb

8. Appositive (usually particles such as ANA, KATA, AB...)

I s=
ometimes put the adverb (5) after the modal (6) and before the verb
(7) bec=
ause it seems to me that it is modifying the verb and not the
modal. I see =
a difference in:

An boni pote kapti plu piski.

An pote boni kapti plu pis=
ki.

One says his ability is good, the other his catching is good. It seems=

logical to me!

Saluta,
