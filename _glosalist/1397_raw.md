Dear Harrisro
I am iraqi doktor, know esperanto. the chatroom is http://tec=
h.groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist/
I loved glosa at first, for being simpl=
e with greek words, but its simplicity is too confusing!  e.g apo=3D remove=
, without, removing, lacking  etc,  Learn it if you desire, but read  previ=
ous chat pages   by going to calender,  after pressing home  in left of pag=
e. I now like mondlango much better, it is similar to esperanto but simpler=
 than glosa and  very  clear : go to wikipedia: mondlango.

Subject: [glosalist] gl=
osa room

  
Hey there I am also a esperantisto. I still learn it once in a=
 while but have also found Glosa. I was wondering if there is a glosa room =
where people meet and chat?

Happy learning.
