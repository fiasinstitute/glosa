One of my quibbles is kron (time). I'm sorry for sublimating such a 
petty =
issue, but kron appears to have two different meanings: 
(1) time as in a p=
articular time, instant, brief time; 
(2) 'time' as in number of occasions,=
 repetition, numeration. 
 
For example: 
ali kron -- any time 
Mi pa telef=
ono a(d) fe bi kron. -- I phoned her 'twice (two times)'. 
Bibe u-ci medika=
-ma tri kron singu di. -- Take this medicine 'three 
times' a day. 
Kron an=
 veni place dic(e) a(d) mi. -- When (at the time) he comes 
please tell me.=
 
Mi pa du lava u vagona; kron an pa veni. -- I was washing the car 
when h=
e arrived. 
 
To me these two significations seem clearly distinct. Further=
more, 
they manifest to be separate words in Romance languages, as in 
Fren=
ch "fois" (not that I know much French). I am equivocating if it 
should be=
 two different words. Else it may be rather enigmatic to 
some people.
