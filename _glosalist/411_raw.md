From Kevin's Glosa Page:

Prefer words that are not similar to other, unrelated Glosa words. 
Prefer words that have recognizable Greek or Romance origins over 
those that do not. 
Prefer Greek roots over Latin. 
Prefer words that are not "false friends" in English or Romance 
languages. 
Prefer words that share common, recognizable roots with other Glosa 
words. 
Prefer words that are already commonly used by Glosa-pe. 
Prefer words that are easy to pronounce. 
Prefer words that were preferred by the original Glosa authors. 
Prefer shorter words. Shorter words are easier to write, speak, and 
recognize.
