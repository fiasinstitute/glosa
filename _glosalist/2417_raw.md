Sandridge quickly explained to his men the official part of the missive.
> Sandridge tako sti klari a panto polica-an un ergo mero de grama.

The rangers protested against his going alone.
> Plu-la tele-polica-an kritici; an kine solo.

	"I'll get him easy enough," said the lieutenant.
> U sub-kapitana dice: "Mu fu sati facili sto an.

"The girl's got him trapped.
> "U gina tena an.

"And don't even think he'll get the drop on me."
> "Plus-co vi ne sti doxo; an fu gene u vikto supra mi."
