as you say, we need to know quickly and easily where the verb phrase starts - 
the first word could be "pa" , "fu" , "nu", "du", "sio" ( i've been using " 
du" for the present tense) and those words could be used for nothing else so 
"now" might be "nu-tem" and so on. 
u ergo-pe du ergo boni e u an ergo du ergo in u longi tem.
much of the difficulty in reading g wouls be reduced this way'
in the case of "es", it is rare for it to be used as anything but a verb so 
"du" could be left out
u an ergo es ma boni nu-tem de id pa es
