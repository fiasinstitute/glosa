Dear Gary,
   Just to wish you condolencies on the loss of your father - (am just 
catching up on emails hence the delay) -  is a sad time when one loses a 
parent.
   I would like to post on the Glosa forum but as a full-time carer for my 
lovely wife I just seem to have no time to myself anymore.
   Regards,  Davidjp
