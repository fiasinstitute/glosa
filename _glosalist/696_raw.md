I've searched the web for the existence of a project to no avail. Has
anyon=
e ever heard of the concept of a universal primer for a language.
The idea =
is that the primer does not assume the language of the
reader. The primer w=
ould be equally effective regardless of what
languages the reader knows. In=
 this way, only one tutorial is written
rather then one for every language =
in existence or more likely, only
the most common languages leaving the res=
t out in the cold.

I fancied a simple primer as this would be nice for Glo=
sa. Surely many
languages must have at least one primer such as this but, a=
s I said
earlier I can find no such thing.

Again, I must be using the wron=
g key-words in Google; does anyone know
of any such thing?
