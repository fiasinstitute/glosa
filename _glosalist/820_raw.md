Yes, it's been consi=
dered. Fundamental to the idea of Glosa is that it 
is uninflected. That th=
e best grammar is no grammar at all. [Meaning 
grammar in the sense of infl=
exions, part of speech terminations, 
declensions and conjugations]

Also t=
here are many words that naturally end in vowels that don't fit 
into such =
a system, such as: drama, aqa, arena, area, etc
