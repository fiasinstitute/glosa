Ian--

When you don't have a word, the trick is to say what the word means.  I
see several possibilities:

The hummingbird hovered in the air next to the rose bush.

U Trokili avi tena se in aero para u rosa dendro.
...sto kine in aero...
(The first two use verboids.  These are the most basic.)

...peti in aero... (Akorda Myaleee)
...sta-peti in aero...
...plankto-peti in aero...
... feno sta in aero...

David--

Regarding my father, thank you.  Regarding your wife-- You're a wise man.
 Languages don't love you back.  I think I combined the family/time
problem by teaching Glosa to our two daughters.  It helped them a lot
with vocabulary too.

Saluta,
