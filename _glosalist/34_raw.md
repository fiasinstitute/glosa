The Glosa-dictionary (GID) on http://www.glosa.org/gid/ has been
updated.

Now half (A-L) of the word list from the book "Espaï¿½ol-Glosa 1000"
by Richard Burrows, Wendy Ashby and Ronald Clark, 1992 (backward
translated from Spanish to English) is included.



New: the dictionary is now also available in PDF-format:
  www.glosa.org/gid/glen.pdf .

Perhaps the pdf-version is a little better for printing.  It has three
columns per page.

If you do not have it already: you need special software to handle
pdf-files, normally the "Acrobat Reader",  free downloadable from
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html .



Thanks to all who have registered already here at Yahoo.  Hello and
welcome!

And thanks to Bill, who has uploaded the glosalist-archive into the
file section of this Yahoo-group.  (Hi Bill, I got 70 "notification
mails" for that, one for each uploaded file, a service of Yahoo.)

Saluta - Marcel
