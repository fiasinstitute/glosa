Ave!

Here's hoping, Doro. Glosa is too beautiful and easy an AIL to lose to
obscurity. It seems the Novial community is on the fast track to
inactivity and I just don't want to see the same thing happen to our
community. Of the three AIL's that I have knowledge in (Esperanto,
Glosa, Novial) I find Glosa to be the most efficient and fun to use.

Plu saluta,
Scott
