Hm. You're certainly right. I _like_ complexity and Latejami _is_
complex. =
Yet I think complexity is necessary, since it's what grammar
is made of. Fo=
r an IAL we have to try and find a grammar with only a
few complexity, but =
complexity will be there as long there is grammar.

>Needless to say, some =
people object to Glosa claiming
that it is simply English sentence structur=
e with a changed
vocabulary. Of course, I would not have stayed with Glosa =
were that
the case. Whether we will ever get an International Auxiliary
Lan=
guage adopted officially for planet Earth, I don't know. It is my
expectati=
on that I will be joining Ron - on the other side - before
the world is rea=
dy to use an IAL. So, Glosa could just be an
experiment before its time.

s=
ts:
I expect Glosa to be complex as well. Maybe it's so easy to learn that
=
many people may not need to learn it's grammar? In either case =96 thank
yo=
u so far!
