I should like Glosa to have a definite verb second order. we would know where 
we were then and the business of object(s), predicates etc would not matter.. 
there would be no need to put any punctuation between the main phrases and 
extras/adverbials at the begining etc coul be separated from the main phrases by 
commas.
