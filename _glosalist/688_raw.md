Karo Robin,

I'm not sure how important an ISO code is for glosa. ISO langu=
age 
codes are shorthand usually for computer data formats, xml markups, 
e=
tc. You can find out more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639

You'l=
l notice that the iso code for english, "en" was used in the 
link. 

My in=
terest in it is that Wikipedia requires one in the submission 
for a new la=
nguage form. 

It looks like a project to get a language added to the wikip=
edia and 
a six month waiting period. There's no guarantee they will accept=
.

A glosa wiki address might look something like the following fake 
addre=
ss: http://gls.wikipedia.org/wiki/glosa
