Hi all,

My 100 word story 'The Gondolier' has been translated into 21 lang=
uages, including Latin, and is currently being translated into Esperanto. I=
 discovered that fellow author Frank Roger has had some of his stories tran=
slated into Glosa and I wondered if anyone would like to have a go at trans=
lating mine?

Thanks,

Gareth
