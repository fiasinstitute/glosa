it is not really clear who is in charge of glosa as many of its founders  are 
no longer with us, others have other problems etc.
 
I don't know if this would help - here is a proposition :-
the pronunciation of g is supposed to be phonetic but one or two puzzling  
exceptions have crept in from english. the problem has been solved for us by the 
 international phonetics association/alphabet.
I propose that all the letters in g are poronounced as in ipa - "x" now  
becomes like the german/scots etc "ch", q becomes a variety of "k" and we  
specifically write the following "w" sound as "u" - "qu" will sound reasonably  like 
the english version.
 
so that is a proposition made by syd pidd, obviously he will vote for it,  it 
has a vote of +1
any more votes for or against?
 
sid
