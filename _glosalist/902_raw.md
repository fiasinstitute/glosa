It depends on your operating system=
.  If you have Windows, you can
download the program at ar.geocities.com/er=
nobe/gish.zip .  This is a
commandline program, which means you need access=
 to the shell.  At
present I use Debian Linux so I wouldn't know exactly ho=
w you should
go about gaining access to your shell, if you have Windows.  W=
indows
or Linux users, and generally anyone who wants to use the program
sh=
ould follow the instructions at
