Hi,

Unfortunately, you cut out my little bit on the ability to send and receive
messages by email. All you've done is to expand on it, and very greatly.
Same with my bit on the ability to promote glosalist to other Internet users
through Yahoo! groups. But I don't mind plagiarism if it does some good.

But we do lose the ability to send email to all members of the list, i.e. to
those who have chosen to not receive posts by email. For those, we depend on
them going to the group web page and reading the messages, if they don't
lose interest or forget about it.

But a Yahoo! group is a good idea and I'll be joining.

Anthony
