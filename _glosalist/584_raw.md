glosa is not alone. I  decided  some weeks ago to look at esperanto, I made 
several enquiries about buying material etc. after about 3 months, i managed to 
have my local library find teach yourself espareanto which I borrowed but so 
far it has been difficult to get anywhere. looking back at gloas , i would 
have much the same problems I suspect
so - wanted - a list of glosa sites .... (again)
