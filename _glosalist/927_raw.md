I am of  origin of (ashamed to say) a colored race (not Himalayan), 
what is there to be ashamed of? i am english and white - it was white  people 
that made their fortunes turning black/coloured people into slaves - who  
should be more ashamed of their evil
 
let us forget it .......
what is there to be proud of? we are trying to make it easier/possible for  
people of all colours/races/ to talk to each other to promote peace - an  
example is my being able to write to marcel in glosa.  50 years ago, his  nation 
perhaps relations were sent across the sea to bomb my city but now he and  i are 
working together in our own way to spread friendship
 
you be proud of showing an interest if peacemaking glosa - you could be  
doubly proud if you wrote in glosa...........
i am interested in the construction of glosa - it would be very helpful if  
you would tell us what language you speak and how it compares with g.
 I had some contact with hindi some time ago and am thiking of how  glosa 
could use hindi word order -verb final,  also some slight contact  with welsh 
verb first 
 
should now put this into glosa but i am a bit slow with translation
