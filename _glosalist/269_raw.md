I propose you that an english text should be translated to Glosa by a comp=
etent one, and then an another competent one (who had never read that origi=
nal text before) would translate it back to english. At the end we could co=
mpare the original text with the text translated there and back.

That proc=
edure we could repeat by Esperanto, and Ido. I think, this would be a good =
way to test the abilities of the planned languages. Then we will be able to=
 decide about the best chojce.

Of course, it needs many trials to get a re=
liable result.

Laslo
