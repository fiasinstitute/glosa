Using the Oct. 2005 versions of the glosa internet dictionaries found
at gl=
osa.com, I've created a simple command-line tool to translate to
and from G=
losa, and a more complicated program that translates entire
web pages.  Thi=
s latter looks up equivalents when the original was not
found , so that for=
 example 'feelings' returns '?plu-algesia'.  It
recognizes the plural indic=
ated by the 's', looks up feeling, and if
that fails looks up feel, having =
recognized the noun form of feel.  
'Think' exists in the dictionary, but '=
thinking' doesn't, so it
returns '?puta', and likewise several other common=
 word endings in
English are examined and discarded in order to find the ke=
y term to
translate, and then corresponding Glosa prefixes or sufixes are a=
dded
as needed.  The web page translator has a command-line mode as well,
w=
hich translates everything that is put on the command line into an
equivale=
nt line of Glosa.  It can also translate ordinary text files,
but in this c=
ase it will consist of one single, long line with no line
endings.  In orde=
r to  get line breaks in your text file you will need
to add '<>' at the en=
d of them.  Here is the web site where you can
download it:
