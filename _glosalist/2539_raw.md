Ave 3zja,

Wendy Ash=
by once wrote, if I remember correctly, that =E2=80=9CU(n)=E2=80=9D does no=
t
have a demonstrative meaning. It just marks a noun phrase and that it
is =
singular. 

In most cases =E2=80=9Cu-ci=E2=80=9D is fine and =E2=80=9Cu-la=
=E2=80=9D is not needed.

Ja, the Glosa authors believed, a conjunct=
ion =E2=80=9Cthat=E2=80=9D is not needed. 
Here in glosalist many people we=
re not happy about that, so the 
Esperanto-word =E2=80=9Cke=E2=80=9D has be=
en added to the word list on glosa.org,
but it is no original Glosa word. 
=

Sometimes you can use =E2=80=9Cte=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Ctende=E2=80=9D (int=
ention) instead:
  Mi ergo; te mi gane valuta. 
In this sentence =E2=80=9Cs=
o=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cseqe-co=E2=80=9D would work also.
