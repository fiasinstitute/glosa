 To Igor Wasilewski


Thanks for your answer.
I had always have understood =
that Glosa uses words whose meaning is an "idea", and they have not a certa=
in sense, but they can have up to four senses (the word classes). And I agr=
ee with the word order as absolutely necessary, but even in this case the p=
rases is ambiguous.

It seems that what I was afraid, it was proved. The Gl=
osa seems to be using expressions like English.
Those expressions you have =
to learn in advance, otherwise you will be incapable of using, understandin=
g the Glosa. 

"Mi dona auxi a mu".  -  dona auxi =3D>  it is an expression=
 that you have to learn by all means, otherwise you will not be able to use=
 the Glosa.

"dice u petitio" - to ask for something =3D>  it is an express=
ion
"dice u qestio" - to ask about something =3D>  it is an another express=
ion

Otherwise you could get an another meaning of the words, like: 

"dice=
 u petitio" - to say a petition (not: to ask for sg.)
"dice u qestio" - to =
say a question (not to ask about sg. )

Maybe there are not too much differ=
ences, but the fiction writers (and it's readers)  need those subtles.
