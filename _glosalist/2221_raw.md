Is the author of the wikipedia-article here in glosalist, =
or did
anyone of our group contributed to it?  If so, I would like to thank=

you - for the help, that it gives to our language and, personally,
thanks =
for its link to the glosa.org homepage.

Over the last years, we had a lot of discussion here in g=
losalist
about this final vowel problem.  I like your suggestions very well=
 and
I would appreciate a word derivation like this.  But please note, that=

wikipedia is misleading here. 

Glosa words are NOT derived from Greek and=
 Latin words nor by means of 
methods based on classical philology. 
Glosa =
words are derived FROM ENGLISH WORDS with Greek and Latin
origin! 

And so =
we get words like "noktu" (nocturnal), "lakti" (lactic),
"fonta" (fountAin)=
 and so on. 

Saluta - Marcel
