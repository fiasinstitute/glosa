It seems to me tha=
t the current owner is the board of trustees of the 
Glosa Education Organi=
sation

I believe they would regard Glosa as complete as it stands

I think=
 it is good that there is "standard" for the language, but that 
doesn't st=
op people trying out "variants". Personally, I too would be 
in favour of d=
ropping these liaison/elision, except for poetry and 
relaxed speech
