"u ergo-pe" noun phrase subject, easy to see "u" starts the phrase, "du" also 
could start a verb phrase
"the work-person does work well and the-his work does work in the long time" 
awful english but clear.. "u" only or almost always starts a noun phrase
"pa ergo" or "fu ergo" "pa/fu" almost always start  verb phrase. sentences in 
the past or future tense, I find easy to read . Those sentences.I have 
difficulty with are very often  in the present so I suggest we use "du" or "nu" or 
something else to mark the beginning of a present tense verb phrase. if we 
could agree on what, two thirds of the glosa that causes me confusion would be put 
right  and about the same fraction of the complaints voiced in glosalist over 
the past few years also
Esperanto solves this problem with "is/as/os"  - "estas/estos/estis"
