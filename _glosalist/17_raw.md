Yes, you are right, that is another possibility.  But the solution on
one's own PC is only good, when he has very long online-time or better
a 24-hour-server without vacations.  Otherwise a direct discussion -
like we rarely had also on glosalist - is not possible, when the
list-owner switches off his PC and goes to bed.

I see obvious differences between the mailing-list providers and
between the different software-solutions.  When we start new, why not
take the best one?  But you are right, our virus attacks do not
belong to the EZMLM-program or Zeta.org.

It is all the same to me, WHO.  My first choice would be, Robin would
moderate the existing list.  My second, anybody else would moderate a
new mailing-list, perhaps someone, who can start an advert-free
list.  My third, if nobody feels like doing it, take the yahoo-group I
started ( http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist ,
glosalist@yahoogroups.com ).  With the simple option "No attachments"
we can solve the virus-problem very easily without any work of
moderation.

I just do not like the situation of glosalist, that could easily be
misused now by idiots, criminals and other cyberterrorists.
