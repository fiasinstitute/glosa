Hi Ricky,
 
     Welcome to the group!  Actually, the sentence 'mi desira =
es forti' has both interpretations in Glosa.  In most cases, context should=
 determine what you mean.  If in a particular case it is essential that onl=
y one interpretation be valid, you can rewrite the sentence:
 
1.  Mi desir=
a es; mi es forti.
2.  Mi habe u forti desira.
 
-Ian

Subject: [glosalist] Question from new learner

  



I have recen=
tly come across this language and have started studying it. So far, I reall=
y like it. But I have a question. If I say or write 'Mi desira es forti' do=
es this mean 'I desire to be strong' or 'My desire is strong'? If it can me=
an either, you need a way to determine which it means. 

LFN, like Glosa, d=
oes not use word endings to determine part of speech and 'me' and 'my' are =
identical. When the meaning is ambiguous they solve the problem by putting =
la 'the' in front of me, 'La me desira es forte.' Which means 'my desire is=
 strong' while 'Me desira es forte' would mean 'I desire to be strong.' I d=
on't really like this solution but it is a solution. Does Glosa have a way =
to deal with this?
