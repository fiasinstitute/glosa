Hello Robin and all!
I took your comment about simplification serious and h=
ave invested a
bit more time :)
So, there is a Windows Setup program for Gl=
osaReader now, making
installation on a Windows machine a lot easier and mo=
re familiar.
I also wrote some documentation, including installation instru=
ctions,
usage of the program, and a step-by-step example of how to integrat=
e
the program into a web page. It would be nice to know, which part is
part=
icularly tricky or unclear. So if you have questions, suggestions,
problems=
, etc, you know how to find me :)

Best regards, Eike

       However, for years, I've been saying that Glosa with its
