Karo Llu�s, 

Welcome on Glosalist!  And ...

thanks for your programming work. 

I would like to know: 
- Where are your dictionary files (URL?) or how do they look? 
- Do they have to be on your server or could they be somewhere else
    (e.g. some on glosa.org)? 
- Would your program be crashed by HTML-tags like ä and í
    instead of � and �? 

Fine that you want to keep on with Glosa.  As you have seen, our
language needs a bit more manpower. 

Saluta - Marcel
