Hi!

I haven't seen Glosa website for long, but when I last saw it (around last
year), I read two separate descriptions of Glosa.

One said hundred is 'centi' and other said it is 'hekto', with a message
that the original 'centi' was incorrect.

If Glosa is to become a good IAL (International Auxiliary Language), it
should remove such things as the incorrect 'centi' from its pages.

Well, as I said I haven't recently seen the site. So, if it has been
corrected it would certainly be nice.

Nikhil
