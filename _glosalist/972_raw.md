The best way for Glosa to evolve is for people to use it as it is,
because =
1) it gives others a chance to hear about and learn Glosa, and
2) the users=
 of it will benefit from constructive criticism of their
usage.  "Nu" is a =
word which is meant to distinguish present tense
from past or future tense,=
 when such a distinction is necessary. 
However, "es" can also be used to i=
ndicate the current, present tense
presence of something in the users mind.=
  If you use "nu" in such a
case it is unclear if it is something that the =
user is just thinking
about, or something just now happening to the user.  =
If you make it
obligatory to use "nu", then present tense thoughts are not
=
communicated, and the purpose of the language is missed.  It is the
same fo=
r the other rules of grammar which are common in most other
languages.  The=
 thoughts and intentions of the user are missed,
because the words have bee=
n used as things that communicate something
other than the thoughts of the =
user.  Glosa can be said to be the
opposite of Loglan in many respects, bec=
ause users of Glosa think that
the user influences the shape of the languag=
e, not the other way around.
