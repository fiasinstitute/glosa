Wh=
ere have you seen these examples? 
Its seems to me that the hiato is the ru=
le in Glosa.
Therefore, I have noted the word "gram-ami" in the official li=
st, and
I think that it is an error to keep this form. I prefer the natural=

"grama-ami": "gram" is not "grama" synonymous .

Mi emisi plu ami pro vi.
