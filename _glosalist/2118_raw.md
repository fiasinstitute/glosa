(Last Christmas someone gave me a few episodes of the old TV show THE CISC=
O KID.

The show says it is based on a short story by O.=
Henry.
> U drama dice; id es ge-establi per mikro-nara ex O.Henry.

Now wit=
h the Internet I was able to find out what the story was.
> Per Inter-Reti =
mi nu pote detekti; u nara es qo.

The fact is the story had little to do w=
ith the TV series.
> U faktu es; u nara pa habe proxi zero relati de TV ser=
ie.

But I always wanted to translate a Western into Glosa, so....
> Anti-c=
o mi pa panto-kron volu translati u bovi-an nara per Glosa, iso....

I have=
 left out a few demeaning phrases.
> Mi pa apo oligo non-honora frase.

As =
for the TV show, I have put an article on it on my blog:

The Cisco Kid had killed six men in more or less fair scrimma=
ges, had
murdered twice as many, and had winged a larger number whom he
mod=
estly forbore to count.

The Kid was twenty-five, looked twenty; and a careful insurance
co=
mpany would have estimated the probable time of his demise at, say,
twenty-=
six.
