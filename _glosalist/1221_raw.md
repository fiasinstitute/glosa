Hello Gareth,
   I reckon that I would be some way down the list of suitable translators for your story  but if no one else offers I'll have a go.

  Subject: [glosalist] Short Story Translation


    Hi all,

  My 100 word story 'The Gondolier' has been translated into 21 languages, including Latin, and is currently being translated into Esperanto. I discovered that fellow author Frank Roger has had some of his stories translated into Glosa and I wondered if anyone would like to have a go at translating mine?

  Thanks,

  Gareth
