Cows eat grass
head concept of process section (verb phrase) -   h1=eat
Modifier of h1 [time] -m1 of h1=past/present/future  intermittent
m1h1=ppf int
M2h1[process order]=result + cause  [res/cau]
cause=cow, result=grass
head of indicate section -  H2=grass
M1h2[number]=one (singular noun)
M2h2[process order]= [res/cau] 
 
headof info - h3=cow
M1h3[number]=more than one (plural  noun)
M2h3[process order]= [rescau] 
 
sentence order in glosa is indicate + process + inform
phrase order is  simple modifiers + head + complex modifiers, the first 
modifier is either  number  or time [ these introduce the phrase]
so, here we have:-  m1h2 + m2h2 +h2 + m1h1 + m2h1 + h1 + m1h3 + m2h3 + h3 
 
indic section
m1h2=u, 
m2h1 here the process order is not  indicated
h2=gra
 
process section
m1h1= I use "du" as in "do eat" in older english. I do  so as "du" is related 
to " dura" [continue], other writers translate "du" as "am  eating" =  
talking about a short time. other writers leave the introductory  word altogether 
and it is sometimes difficult to find where the phrases begin  and end and where 
the head concept is. in glos they seem to use "ca" to express  
past/present/future, I suggest we use it too.
Usually, a sentence has the  order cause + process + result, but here the 
order is reversed to rescau from  caures.glosa indicates this by using the 
modifier "gene"
info  section
h1=vora
 
info section
process order is rescau so glosa starts this section with  the pre-modifier 
"per"
m1h3= more than one -> plu
h3=bovi
(u) gra du  (or "ca") gene vora per plu bovi
