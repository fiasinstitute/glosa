Hi,

Well, I can say with all certainty that web users won't unsubscribe if
they're not getting anything by email. They'll just stop using the web site
which means that active members would presumably be less than the total
number of members. But we can make the Yahoo! group more interesting by
using the other functions available to us. An example would be to place
scans of the Glosa books in the photo section and links to other Glosa web
sites in the Links section.

Anyway, I'll be unsubscribing this list following the sending of this email.
C'yall in the new Yahoo! list.

Saluta
Anthony
