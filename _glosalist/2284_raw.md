The Final Battle (from the Society of War against Aliens)

The pyramid's el=
evator is taking your soldiers far below the surface
of the planet.

They c=
ome to a large intersection; it has many tunnels and rooms.

An alien brain=
 is hidden somewhere in the labyrinth. The aliens are
going to turn all Ear=
th's peoples into slaves.

We must stop them; the alien brain must be destr=
oyed!

Fun!

The only thing I was a little shaky on was "Konditio na=
 volu sto mu."

To solve the problem of where your lines split on the page:=
 Turn off
the "word wrap" before you copy text to your e-mail server.
