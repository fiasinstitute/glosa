dear robin and all
the chalk and cheese bit makes the contrast of the two very useful and 
interesting each could learn from yhe other and still be their own selves - if they 
are both easy and clear one could use both without their hindering the other - 
this is why I am looking at a common denominator
I am 79 and overdrawn on physical resourses - this is why i am interested in 
a crisis glosa, esperanto etc
i have a computer prog which is helpful but a tightening up of glosa would 
make it better and , i think, better than esperanto
