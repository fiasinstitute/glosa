....................the talk of chomski made me think about seagulls  -
that is a large group of them circling quickly around. the birds are  
shreaking loudly. are they  warning  everybody of danger?
 
my sentence might be analysised:-
that+indic+sing is+info+pres  large+mod+info(+sing) group+info+sing 
them+mod+info+plur(indic+plur)  circling(+info+pres) quickly(+mod+info+pres) 
around(+mod+info+pres).  bird+indic+plur shreak+info+pres loud+mod+info. they+indic+plur 
 warn+info+pres+cont everybody+info+plur danger+info+sing  =question  
 
in some languages such as slavic ones my additions are replaced by suffixes  
but glosa uses word order:-
the indic group    (indicated) is  usually first next is info/pres etc and 
then the rest of the info
 
so:-
1)indic= that, 2)info+pres=is, 3) info+simple modifier (large)+  info/sing 
head
indic, info+sing, info
 
that is th large group of ths bird they d above quick circle .
