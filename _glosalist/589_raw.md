Mi ne es glosa-pe, sed glosa interese mi.

I write this as an outsider, but I think Glosa could
have great potential.

Depending on its meaning one word can serve as noun,
adjective, verb, 
adverb and even a preposition - less words to learn.
Fine !
However, such a language does have its downside. It is
very easy to write
a sentence that is incomprehensible to the reader.
English can do that too,
even for native speakers !

I have found most Glosa sentences easy to read, but
some are more difficult to
decipher than Classical Latin. I feel this must put
people off the language.

To show what I mean I am using an example text from
the Glosa website.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glosa - puri komunika
(Ronald Clark & Wendy Ashby, ï¿½ GEO, 1996; from the
newspaper "Plu Glosa Nota", 
ISSN 0265-6892, No. 75, January/February 1996; HTML by
Paul O. Bartlett, 1996) 

Ex kron a kron uno civi fu protesta; "Sed Glosa feno
kopi un English modela; 
sura id debi difere?" 

Panto Cina ami dice iso. Glosa funktio iso Cina
lingua. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above example the first sentence is fine. I
could read this without having to
consult a vocabulary. The words "fu, feno, debi"
indicate the verb cluster and the
rest of the sentence falls into place.

Not so in the next two shorter sentences. I have no
idea where the verbal cluster begins.
In the context I think the point is being made that
Glosa is similar to Chinese, but
not being able to get the exact meaning of the
sentences, leaves me in some doubt.

In the first sentence, is the verbal cluster, 'dice',
'dice iso', or perhaps even
'ami dice iso'?

Literally the sentence says:
" all china friend say identical"

Assuming that 'dice' is the verb, are pan cina ami
agreeing with the criticism 
in the first sentence that Glosa is too much like
English, or are they saying 
that Glosa is like Chinese, which the third sentence
seems to say ?

In the third sentence I assume that the verb is either
funktio, or iso, or both. 
I can, I think, get the meaning, but it would be nice
to be sure.

In the above example it is a just bit annoying, but in
a different context it could
mean that a reader comes away with totally the wrong
meaning, and that is the sort 
of thing that would put people off Glosa.

May I, as an outsider, suggest that perhaps a 'nu'
could be slipped into such 
sentences to split off the subject cluster from the
verbal cluster. The easier it 
is to read, the more people may want to read it.

I have also noticed that there are older versions of
the vocabulary in existence, 
and it is not clear which one you should be using.
This is surely not helpful to anyone wishing to learn
Glosa.

Sorry for the criticism, but it is meant to be
contructive. I think the secret of
Glosa is to write clearly and simply, even if it takes
a few more words to do so, and
that the writer should take care to ensure that the
reader will easily be able to
understand what has been written.

Good luck to pan glosa-pe ! I hope you succeed.
