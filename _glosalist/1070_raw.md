Hogben's critique is summed up as:

Too much grammar of the wrong sort. By =
that he means the flexions 
taken over from Indo-European and prefixes and =
affixes

His argument is an analytic language shares the highest common 
de=
nominator of grammar among languages as different as Chinese, 
Japanese, Ar=
abic, Bantu and Spanish

Glosa is fully flexion-free

And the essential voc=
abulary is too big (more than 1000) and too 
unfamiliar (mainly words taken=
 from German and Russian) and prefixes 
and affixes again (which he sees as=
 duplications of existing root 
words)

Glosa has word economy to reduce th=
e essential words to a minimum. 
And it takes these words from Latin and Gr=
eek because these are 
becoming familiar around the world with the spread o=
f scientific 
terms into everyday life
