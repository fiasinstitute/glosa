Plagiarism. Sheesh. Newbies. Sheesh. Top-posters. Sheesh!

Ah, well, see, I did preface my comments with "Assuming that I haven't
misunderstood". That was your cue to clarify, and to politely correct me
if I was in the wrong. Apparently I did misunderstand; your argument is
that we would lose the guarantee that all who are subscribed will receive
the email messages. True. A bit of expansion would have been helpful there,
eh? Your statement was poorly written and unclear.

Building upon your thought (gee, am I plagiarizing again?) this means that
with Yahoo! they will be less likely to unsubscribe, since they have the
option of disabling email and only checking in when they feel like it.

Hmm. Besides the frequently arriving virus, I'm now hit with childishness
and personal attack. Perhaps it's time to leave.

Salata,
Bill

If you've got a /misc, do you really need any other directories?
