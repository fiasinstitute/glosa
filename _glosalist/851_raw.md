Plu Amika,

         Sorry about the late reply,
         In the past, members of Glosalist and its predecessor, have 
put in group effort to complete a project.  A subgroup within 
Glosalist could study NSM seriously, and create an NSM version of Glosa.

         Needless to say it would be a waste of time if we had not 
previously conferred with the people in charge of the NSM project.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
