Yeah, that's some strange stuff. Although after some thought it makes 
sense from an English speaker's perspective. There is an English idiom 
"bought off" meaning "bribed". It is used in a sentence like this, "I 
bought off the officer to get out of the traffic ticket". Less often the 
word "buy" is also used directly as a synonym for bribe. "The skating 
judges were bought".

"ransom" in the list for "merka" also caught me off guard. The umbrella 
concept here seems to be to exchange money for something. There are no 
implications of ethical legitimacy or property rights in the word as in 
all the English equivalents.
