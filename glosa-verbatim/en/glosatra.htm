<H1>Glosatra - A Little Computer Program for Glosa</H1>
</CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P> Glosatra is a little computer program, that helps to translate
from and into Glosa by simply looking up the words of a text in a
dictionary.

<H3>Properties</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Glosatra is a primitive command line program for the console.  It
  has no menus, mouse support, graphics and things like that.
<LI> It can "translate" Glosa-English and English-Glosa.
<LI> The program finds words, word groups and compounds with and
  without hyphem in the dictionary (last things not with
  <TT>-t</TT>&nbsp;option).
<LI> It tries to give a suggestion even if the final vowel of the
  Glosa word in the text is wrong (not with <TT>-t</TT>&nbsp;option).
<LI> It tries to recognize English words, even if they are not in the
  basic form (not with <TT>-t</TT>&nbsp;option).
<LI> No case sensitivity: capitalization or not does not matter.
<LI> It can use always the latest version of the
    <A HREF="../gid/index.html">
    Glosa Internet Dictionary</A>,
  just download it above.
<LI> Load and run, - no complicated installation because of its
  simplicity. 
<LI> Runs on MS-DOS/Windows and Linux.  It could certainly run on
  other platforms, too.  The source code is offered above.
<LI> It can use standard-I/O-streams.  So it could be started and used
  by other programs, even within a text editor.
<LI> It is free of charge.
<LI> It does in no way claim to be errorfree, professional or
  comfortable.
<LI> Sorry for this silly bug: the input-file has to end with a space,
  a comma, a full stop or a line feed.  Otherwise you will loose the
  last word. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Installation and Usage</H3>

<UL>
<LI> You have the executable program for your system, the dictionary
  files <TT>glen.txt</TT> and  <TT>engl.txt</TT> and your Glosa
  textfile <TT>intext.txt</TT>, a plain ASCII textfile, in the
  directory you are actually working in (or somewhere, where your
  system can find these files). <BR>
  Then start your console or a DOS-window and type in <BR>
  <PRE>
    glosatra intext.txt outtext.txt 
  </PRE>
  Your text with a vocabulary list will then be in the file 
  <TT>outtext.txt</TT>.  You can read it with an editor or just on the
  screen <BR>
  <PRE>
    more outtext.txt. 
  </PRE>
<LI> You can view a help screen with <TT>-i</TT>: <BR>
  <PRE>
    glosatra -i
  </PRE>
  (On MS-Win/DOS you can call the options also with "/", e. g.
  <TT>glosatra /i</TT>.)<BR>
  <BR>
<LI> Translating in the other direction, English to Glosa, works
  with <TT>-e</TT>:
  <PRE>
    glosatra -e intext.txt outtext.txt
  </PRE>
<LI> When you want to take another dictionary file, take the
  <TT>-d:</TT>-option: <BR>
  <PRE>
    glosatra -d:mydictionary.txt intext.txt outtext.txt
  </PRE>
  You can try to translate from and into other languages with this
  option, if you would have a dictionary file in a Glosatra-readable
  format for it.  But note, that no special characters are supported
  and that you will get problems to find anything if your languages
  have a lot of inflections. <BR>
  <BR>
<LI> When your files are in other directories, you can specify them
  of course, e. g. <BR>
  <PRE>
    c:\dir1\glosatra.exe -d:c:\dir2\glen.txt c:\dir3\intext.txt c:\dir4\outtext.txt
  </PRE>
<LI> Glosatra is slow,  but with the <TT>-t</TT>-option, you will get
  faster and fewer output, which is easier to survey: <BR>
  <PRE>
    glosatra -t intext.txt outtext.txt
  </PRE>
<LI> You can use standard output and view the output directly or
  you direct it to a file.  Or you choose also standard input,
  e.&nbsp;g. <BR>
  <PRE>
    echo " ... solo pusi textu ... "|glosatra 
  </PRE>
  and apply Glosatra in a pipe, a shell script or by or within
  another program. <BR>
  <BR>
<LI> Or interactively:  After <BR>
  <PRE>
    glosatra
  </PRE>
  or - for English
  <PRE>
    glosatra -e
  </PRE>
  simply type in your text.  After each &lt;Return&gt; you will get a
  vocabulary list.  The program ends with &lt;Control&gt;-<TT>C</TT>.
  <BR>
  <BR>
<LI> You can use Glosatra even within a text editor.  For example
  with the editor <B>Emacs</B>
    (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">
    www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</A>
  or
    <A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org">
    www.xemacs.org</A>): <BR>
  Load a text into the buffer with "<TT>emacs intext.txt</TT>", mark
  the block you want to translate with
  &lt;Control&gt;-&lt;Space&gt; and the cursor keys.  Then type
  "&lt;Alt&gt;-<TT>x shell-command-on-region</TT> &lt;Return&gt;", and
  after the prompt "<TT>:</TT>" type "<TT>glosatra</TT>".
  Glosatra's output will be displayed in a new window.
  With "&lt;Alt&gt;-<TT>1</TT>" before "&lt;Alt&gt;-x
  <TT>shell-command-on-region: glosatra</TT>"
  the marked text will be replaced by Glosatra's output. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Sample output:</H3>

<P> After </P>
<PRE>
  echo "Nu tu pote uti tu puta-me te cerka plu verba. " | glosatra 
</PRE>
<P> you get: </P>
<PRE>

<P> When you have a text file, that crashes down the program, please
send it to me under

It would be great, if you tell me, when you use Glosatra with other
languages or on other systems.  Please do not complain about my 
programming style or missing features. Thank you for visiting this
