<H1>A Word Derivation Scheme for Glosa</H1>

<BR>

<P> It seems to be simply like this: </P>

<P> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Glosa words are built from</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">English foreign words, ...</FONT> 
<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">... which have Latin or Greek origin and 
      ...</FONT> 
<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">... which have cognates in the other world 
      languages Spanish, French, German and Russian.</FONT>
<LI> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Spelling is simplified (ph --> f, th --> t

<P> [When I once was disappointed about Glosa's vocabulary, I was
looking for a way, how it could be fixed/reformed/refined, and I
sketched the text below.  Meanwhile many problems in the words are
solved.  So the ideas below are perhaps not further necessary.]

<P>
How are the Glosa words built?  An answer to this question is necessary 
to remove the many insufficiencies from the Glosa vocabulary. <BR> 

The first part (I) of this text is written by the Glosa authors 
themselves. It tells, that Glosa words are built from English foreign 
words. <BR>

The second part (II) introduces to the word derivation of Latino sine 
Flexione/ Interlingua de Peano.  LsF is another 
international auxiliary language, that is quite similar to Glosa. 
Of course, these ideas are not valid for Glosa, but maybe nevertheless 
interesting here. <BR>

(III) gives a draft overview about the derivation of Glosa words 
directly from classical roots.  <BR>

(IV) gives the direction to a more systematical attempt.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<H2>  I)  The authors's method</H2> 

<P> [The following lines are written by the Glosa authors Ron Clark and 
Wendy Ashby themselves.  They are from the Glosa-newspaper "Plu Glosa 
Nota", no. 37.  They say mainly, that Glosa words are built from English 
foreign words.  I personally think, that such a domination of English 
is not good for an international auxiliary language.  On the other hand 
a lot of these words are really international and not only English. 
The result of this method is unfortunately often not unambiguous and so 
not always satisfying.] </P> 


<H3>Mega-Glosa, but...</H3>

<P> As regards your first suggestion.  We agree that to sell Glosa to
bodies such as EEC, UN, UNESCO etc. MEGA-GLOSA, a large vocabulary is
essential.  Scientists, literary people and politicians require it. </P> 

<P> We however insist that GLOSA&nbsp;1000 must remain the Centre, the Heart of
Glosa.  Glosa is a truly International Auxiliary Language.  It will
appeal to the motivated Third World artisan only if it is simple to
learn and accurate, and able to deal with all kinds of information
exchange.  Glosa will not be allowed to fall into the trap of becoming
only a holiday language for wealthy people of the industrialized
nations.  The world will never be healthily united until accurate
information is readily available to everyone everywhere, and everybody
in the world has enough to eat, good shelter and a good-allround
education - an education for living not merely for earning a living.
The world has now the means (but not yet the will) to bring all this
about quickly and thoroughly. </P> 

<P> Europeans are used to large vocabularies, which can contribute to mis-
understandings not only between nations but also between classes.  We
hope that although perhaps enjoying the variety and freedom of Mega
Glosa people will at the same time work their way up to Central
Glosa&nbsp;1000. </P>

<P> Below we make some provisional suggestions for forming a Mega
Vocabulary.  Glosa 6000 by the way has all the information for forming
a truly enormous vocabulary.  We shall bring out a Mega Glosa as soon
as possible. </P> 
<BR> 


<H3>Finding the Root</H3>

<P> All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa is to be able to
recognize a Latin and Greek root.  Most of the common ones will be
listed in Glosa&nbsp;1000, the others will be in Glosa&nbsp;6000.  In any
long word of classical origin there may be ... </P>
<PRE>
        Prefix - root - suffix.
   Eg.  SUPER     FLU     OUS
</PRE>
<P> Remember Glosa has no parts of speech; and any Glosa word can act as
any part of speech.  Because the suffix is usually concerned with this
kind of information, whether the word is verb, noun, adjective or
adverb it is usually superfluous for Glosa and can be removed. </P> 

<P> If the Prefix is one with a distinct meaning i. e. one of the
35 listed in PGN 36 this must be retained as it contributes to
meaning, to information.  So generalizing; </P>
<PRE>
   Word minus suffix = Prefix + root.
</PRE>
<P>                       the word you want.
In the above example the root is FLU, to flow, SUPER over; therefore
SUPERFLU, overflow.  In a way forming a Mega Glosa Vocabulary involves
'tail-chopping'. </P>
<BR>


<H3>Points to Note</H3>

<P> Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate.  All you have to do here is
knock off the -te.  confiscate becomes KONFISKA. </P>

<P> Always substitute K for hard Latin c.  So canine becomes KANI, feline
FELI. </P> 

<P> Some words ending -age are of French origin.  These can be kept giving
MESAGE, FOLIAGE. </P> 

<P> No double letters in Glosa, except on a few occasions where a
well-trilled r may have a good echoic effect.  Some examples; </P> 
<PRE> 
 English        GLOSA
 delicious      DELICI        degenerate  DEGENERA
 industrialize  INDUSTRI      subsequent  SUBSEQUE
 contortion     KONTORTI      population  POPULA
</PRE>
<P> In 99 % of all cases this simple method will work perfectly, but
occasionally some part of the suffix may be found useful and can be
retained. </P> 
<PRE>
Words ending -ism  add -o.   REALISMO.  KOMUNISMO.
Words ending -ist  add -i.   REALISTI.  FATALISTI.
Words ending -ment add -a.   PARLAMENTA.  MOVIMENTA.
</PRE>
<P> Biological and medical terms remain unchanged; OAKTREE is QUERKUS.
K can be substituted for Latin C.  Musical terms remain unchanged,
many of these were listed in PGN 16.  Eg. KRESCENDO, FORTISIMO,
DIMUNENDO, ACELERANDO.  French endings like -age above should be
given the French pronounciation. </P> 
<BR>


<H3>The Two Parts of the Latin Verb</H3>

<P> Another possibility of variety arises from the fact that the Latin
verb has two parts, each of which gives rise to great numbers of
Euro-verbs.  Eg; </P>
<PRE>
  to see         infinitive       VIDE  as in VIDEO
                 past participle  VISum as in VISion.
</PRE>
<P> So for GLOSA 'to see' can be rendered by VIDE or VISI.  Other
examples;</P>
<PRE>
  join together  i.               NEKT  as in conNECT
                 pp.              NEXU  as in NEXUs.
  to lead        i.               DUCE  as in reDUCE
                 pp.              DUCT  as in conDUCT.

</PRE>
<BR>

<H3>When is a Word International</H3>

<P> In PGN 35 there was an article on PACTERM, Pan-African-Centre for
TERMinology, centredin Addis Ababa.  All the participants at a recent
seminar in Ethiopia agreed that a term should be recognized as
international when it appeared in French, German, Russian and English.
We use a very large German-Russian Dictionary published in Moscow by
A. A. Lepinga & Straxhovoi.</P> 

<P> See also, the article about INFOTERM in this issue.</P>
<BR>


<H3>Kosmopolitan Greek</H3>

<P> It has been said that if all the words of Greek origin were suddenly
removed from the world's dictionaries all intelligent conversation
would come to an end.  Nowadays scientists turn almost exclusively to
Greek for new terminology.  Three ways by which you can recognize
words of Greek origin. </P> 
<PRE>
1) There are many double consonants. Eg;
   PSYCHOLOGY, CATARRH, RHYTHM, THEME, ARCHITECT, HYPHEN, PNEUMONIA.
2) There are many diphthongs; Eg
   EUPHONY, HAEMOGLOBIN
3) All those words in which ch is pronounced like a k.  Eg;
   ARCHITECT, CHARACTER.
</PRE>
<P> The Greek words are not quite so familiar yet as the Latin, but
they are daily becoming ever more so.  TELE-SCOPE, SYMBOL, SYMPTOM, 
SYMPHONY are all Greek, and they never have undergone any changes.
They are however far more international than the Latin.  They
probably make up a half of Glosa 6000; and the Advanced Glosa
Dictionary is almost entirely Greek. </P>
<BR>

<H3>Glosa E Italiano</H3>

<P> [There is an article in "Plu Glosa Nota", no. 81 about deriving 
Glosa words from Italian.  Unfortunately I have not got it.  Perhaps 
it is interesting here.  Does anybody have it? 
On page 2 of PGN 82 (this issue I have) there is written:] </P>

<P> In PGN 81 na pa dice komo Glosa pote uti moderno Italiano de 
gene id Mega lexiko. ... <BR>
Posi Glosa pote prende plu participi pasato, - ..ATO, -ITO, -ETO 
e -ABILI; kausa plu-ci parola-fini es proxi universali in plu 
Euro-lingua.  ... <BR>
Holo infinito ko -ARE, ERE, IRE diveni -A, -E, -I. </P>

<H2> II)  Ideas of Peano (not Glosa!) </H2> 

<P> [Below is an introduction to the word derivation of Latino 
sine Flexione/ Interlingua de Peano from the book "Key to Interlingua", 
Torino 1931.  LsF is another international auxiliary language, that is 
quite similar to Glosa. 
Of course, these ideas are not valid for Glosa, but maybe nevertheless 
interesting here.
The following text is stolen from Jay Bowks's Europeano-site, 
  <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/2948/">
  http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/2948/</A> 
] </P>

<P> ... </P> 

<P> 1. Interlingua adopts every word common to English, German, French, 
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and every Anglo-Latin word; </P> 

<P> 2. Every word, Which exists in Latin, has the form of the Latin 
stem or root or radical; </P> 

<P> ... </P> 

<P> A few necessary classical Latin words without international 
equivalents are a part of the vocabulary. It takes also non-Latin words 
already in international use, adopting them in the forms which they 
bear in the language of their origin, unless some other form is more 
convenient. The 1915 edition of Peano's Vocabulario Commune contains 
14,000 words which have currency in the leading nations. </P> 

<P> ... </P> 

<P> A few general rules make possible the compilation of an Interlingua 
glossary. If a word has many forms in Latin because of inflections or 
declensions and conjugations, the inflections are suppressed and the 
stem, root, or radical is adopted to give the Interlingua form. 
Interlingua adopts as the stem or root of nouns the Latin ablative case 
which gives the most important part of the word. The Latin dictionary 
gives two forms for each noun, e.g.: rosa, rosae--rose; pes, 
pedis = foot. The first of these forms is called the 
nominative, the second, genitive. Interlingua uses the genitive and from
the Latin dictionary the ablative is established by use of the following:
<BR>
Genitive endings: -ae -i -us -ei -is; are changed to <BR>
Ablative endings: -a -o -u -e -e, which then become <BR>
the Interlingua endings and forms. </P> 

<P> The stem of the verb is obtained by dropping the ending of the 
Latin infinitive -re, which gives the Interlingua word. </P> 

<P> Uninflected Latin words are adopted without change when there is 
only one form: id, et, circa, post; if there is a declensional suffix, 
it may be omitted, e.g., secundum = secundo; multum = multo. </P> 

<P> ... </P> 

<H3>Definition of Words</H3>

<P>1. NOUNS </P>

<P> Any Latin dictionary gives two forms for each noun, for instance: 
<BR>
rosa, rose = rose; pes, pedis = foot. The first form is called 
nominative, the second genitive. The Interlingua nouns are taken from 
the Latin genitive form, by changing the genitive ending in accordance 
with the following table: </P>

<P>latin Genitive ending: -ae -i -us -ei -is </P>

<P>Interlingua ending: -a -o -u -e -e </P>
<PRE>
Examples

Words of Latin Vocabulary      Interlingua Words       English Words
Nominative       Genitive
rosa             rosae         rosa                    rose
laurus           lauri         lauro                   laurel
casus            casus         casu                    case
series           seriei        scrie                   series
pax              pacis         pace                    peace
</PRE>
<P> A few nouns are used in their nominative forms to avoid confusion 
with other words: </P>

<P>"mas" --English "male."</P>

<P>Nouns used only in the plural in Latin may take the following 
Interlingua endings: </P>

<P> 1. -a, when the Latin nominative plural ends in -a, as: <BR>
Latin--arma, Interlingua--arma, English--arms. </P>

<P> 2. -a or -as, when the plural nominative ends in -Ee, as: <BR> 
L.--divitiae. IL.--divitia or divitias. E.--riches. </P>

<P> 3. -os, when the plural nominative ends in -i, as: <BR>
L.--liberi. IL.--liberos. E.--children. </P>

<P> 4. -e or -es, when the nominative plural ends in -es, as: <BR>
L.--majores. IL.--majore or majores. E.--ancestry. </P>

<P> 2. ADJECTIVES </P>

<P> The Latin vocabulary gives the nominative of the three genders, and 
in some instances the genitive. </P> 

<P> The Interlingua form is obtained: </P> 

<P> I. from the nominative neuter: </P> 
<P> (a) by leaving it unchanged when it ends by e; </P> 
<P> (b) by changing it to o when it ends in um; </P> 
<P> II. from the genitive form in all other instances: </P> 
<P> (c) by changing to e the enaing is as in the case of nouns. </P> 
<PRE>
Examples

Latin                           Interlingua     English

celeber celebris celebre        celebre         celebrated
novus nova novum                novo            new
audax audax audax audacis       audace          audacious
</PRE>
<P> 3. VEBBS </P> 

<P> The Latin vocabulary gives the present indicative and the present 
infinitive. By dropping the ending of the infinitive -re, the 
Interlingua form is obtained. </P> 

<P> There are a few exceptions: dic, duc, es, fac, fer, vol. </P> 

<P> 4. UNINFLECTED WORDS </P> 

<P> If they have one single form, this is the Interlingua form: e.g. 
ab, ad, ante, circa, etc. </P> 

<P> If they have a declensional suffix, it may be omitted: <BR> 
secundum = secundo. <BR>
multum = multo. </P> 

<P> B. DERIVATIVE WORDS AND COMPOVNDS </P> 

<P> Many derivative words are in international use. New ones can be 
freely formed, as in English, from the words already in use, by the 
attachment of prefixes and suffixes, provided the meaning warrants such 
formation. For example, the ending " -atione " denotes a process, 
" -tia " denotes a quality, " -ico" denotes pertaining to, " -iza " 
ends a verb denoting the admixture of one thing with another, " -tore " 
denotes a person who performs the act indicated by the stem of the 
word, etc. </P> 

<P> The commonest suffixes and prefixes are given below. </P> 
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>
As indicated above, "bene" may be used to render the prefix "well" either
separately or combined: bene consiliato or beneconsiliato or benconsiliato
= well-advised; "male" may likewise be used to render " ill- " or " mis-
": male famato or malefamato or malfamato = ill-famed; male conceptione or
maleconceptione or malconceptione= misconception. </P> 

<P> The prefixing of the negative "ne" or "non" may ordinarily be used 
to denote the contrary. The preposition "sine" may be used to denote 
lacking, like the suffls "-less" in English. </P> 

<P> The pronoun "qui" with a verb indicates the person performing the 
action, "que" with a verb denotes the instrument used in performing it, 
"quem" with a verb indicates the person on whom or the object on which 
the action is performed. </P> 

<P> Adjectives may be formed by means of "de"; </P> 
<P>
de fratre = fraterno = fraternal.
<P>
Intransitive verbs may be formed with the help of "fi" = become; transitive
with the help of "fac" = make. Fi albo = albo fi = albofi = to become white
= to whiten (intransitive). Fac albo = albo fac = albofac = to make white
= to whiten (transitive). Verbs, however, may be used as transitive or
intransitive, if the meaning in that sentence is unequivocal. Other verbs
may be formed by means of "es" = to be; redde = to render = to make; da =
to givc. Es causa de = to cause; es flexo = to sag; redde triste = to sadden;
to make sad; redde nullo = to annul = to render void; da animo = to encourage
= to give courage.
<P>
6. ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL WORDS
<P>
A few Latin words not in international use are also adopted. Also, words
are taken from any language if in international use.
<P>
7. INTERRELATION OF PARTS OF SPEECH
<P>
The same word may be used as verb or as noun, either without any change,
or with a slight change of the ending in accordance with rules elsewhere
given. Adjectives may be used as adverbs.
<P>
ORTHOGRAPHY
<P>
Latin words retain the old orthography.
<P>
Proper names of persons and places maintain their national orthography as
far as possible: New York, Washington, Roma, etc.
<P>

<H2>III)  Glosa words directly from classical origins, draft impression</H2>


<PRE>

- Some words are derived regularly from the classical words, like 
  Peano suggested. 
  Indefinite words remain as they are (ad, de, si, Greek: kata). 
  -a, -ae get (from ablativus) -a (silva), 
  -us, -us get -u (manu), 
  -is, -is get -i (turi), 
  adjectives -us/-a/-um get -o (karo), 
  verbs with -ere get -e (face), with -are: -a (lauda), -ire: -i 
  (veni). 

- Same with greek.  Greek has no ablativus, so take dativus: 
  -os, -u gets -o (fobo, orto). 

- Greek verbs get -o (1st person singular) (skizo) 

- Latin o-declination-words get the nominativus plural.  So 
  -us, -i get -i (rami, soni, tubi) 
  -er, -ri get -ri (libri [book])
  -um, -i get -a (exempla) 

- Latin -io, -ionis do not get ablativus-ending -ione but keep the 
  nominativs -io (natio, okasio, petitio, religio, tensio). 
  [My personal opinion: -ione is too long, okay, but even -io is a 
  part-of-speech-marker.  Is it one syllable (-yo) or two (-ee-ow)? 
  No, there are two.  But then it is too long, I think.  A lot of 
  these words are derived from verbs.  "pete" and "tende"?] 

- (I suppose: Some Latin words are in international use mainly with 
  their perfect-tense-root.  So they took this root.  That could be
  reasonable.) 
  Words built from the perfect-tense-root get -i 
  (I suppose because of 1st person singular ending.) 
  (cepti, fluxi, komposi) 

- (I suppose for the same reason, international use:) Sometimes the 
  Greek aorist-root is taken instead of present-tense-root (gene). 

- Species names keep nominativus (equs, ursus).

<H2> IV)  Glosa words directly from classical origins, a more 
systematical attempt</H2>

<P> 
A systematical research is needed: examining the words, looking up 
their Greek or Latin origins, sorting them into a scheme of Latin/Greek 
conjugations/declinations and then look, how the Glosa words are built, 
especially the ending vowels and then formulate a new word derivation 
system.

<P>
Suggestion of Peano for his language (Interlingua de Peano/ Latino sine 
Flexione): Particles and interjections remain as they are.  
Glosa seems to follow this suggestion.

<PRE>
a, ad - at; to; towards 
  o: ad 
  c: OK.  The short form "a" is in Latin the short form to "ab", 
     meaning "away", the contrary.  But "a" for "ad" is acceptable, 
     cf. French.  
ab - absent; away; from; off 
  o: ab
