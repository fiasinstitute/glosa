<H1>Glosa, - Missing Words</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
As Charles suggested (and later rejected), I took Paul's 
Base-Vocabulary-list 
  (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary">
  ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary</A>, 
  I used Charles's "mixed salad") 
and Rick Harrison's VITAL-list 
  (<A HREF="http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html">
  http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html</A>)
and put the Glosa words to these English words into the 
"Core"-dictionary.  Sometimes I could not find a fitting Glosa word for 
the English in the Internet Dictionary or I did not like the found 
word.  These missing words are listed here.  Please have a look. 
Perhaps you know good Glosa words for them. 
</P>
<BR>
