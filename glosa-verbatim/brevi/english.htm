<H1>Glosa, an International Auxiliary Language</H1> 

<P> There are many drafts of international auxiliary languages, but
Glosa is the most advanced one with no grammatical endings on the
words (linguists call that an "isolating" structure). It is
designed by Ronald Clark and Wendy Ashby and goes back to Lancelot 
Hogben's Interglossa (1943). </P><BR>   

<P> From The Glosa Basic Reference 
(by Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby, 1994): </P> 

<P> Glosa is an artificial language intended for use among people with 
different native, cultural, or national languages.  It is an auxiliary
language and has no purpose of supplanting or replacing any other
languages.  Its purpose is only to be a common means of communication
for people of different languages.  Glosa has several distinguishing
characteristics: </P> 

<UL> 
<LI> Its structure is very simple and based on semantics. It is an
   analytical language with no inflexions, genders, or diacritical
   marks.  Glosa does have ways of forming plurals, tenses, questions,
   etc., similar to Chinese and Malay, which use a word for each idea,
   but no inflections.  A small number of words handle grammatical
   relationships not otherwise provided for. Many Glosa words can
   serve as more than one part of speech as meaning and common sense
   allow.

<LI> Glosa words are based on Latin and Greek roots common to the chief
   Euro-languages; via science, technology, and medicine, these words
   are penetrating all languages. Although a larger vocabulary is
   available, a base vocabulary of between 1000 and 2000 words handles
   most situations.

<LI> Its pronunciation is simple and regular, and its spelling is
   phonetic.

<LI> Above all, Glosa is neutral. Because it is no one's own language,
   it is available to everyone without jealousy or resentment over the
   dominance of any one or a few national languages. Its use of Latin
   and Greek roots, many of which are already in widespread use, gives
   it internationality.
