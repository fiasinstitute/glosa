  ****** Glosa Vocabulary ******

  The Glosa words are taken from Latin and Greek. So they are known to many
  people by foreign words or by the Roman languages. A limitated vocabulary
  (GlosaÂ 1000 or Centra Glosa), easy to learn for beginners, should satisfy for
  all day situations. For higher demands (science, art, poetry) an extension
  (GlosaÂ 6000 or Mega Glosa) is available.
  To offer a central vocabulary is a good idea and a strength of the Glosa
  design. Unfortunately the many Glosa-1000-lists (you can find some of them
  below) differ from each other. The Glosa Internet Dictionary (GID) is a
  project, that tries to bring together all the existing vocabulary material.

  TheÂ Â  Glosa Internet DictionaryÂ Â  (GID)

  ... is the largest dictionary available for Glosa. It is more comprehensive and
  has less errors than any printed list. It has three levels: Mega (Literary,
  large), Basi (Basic, middle) and Centra (Core, small). Mega contains all Basi
  words and Basi contains all Centra words. Centra has less than 2000Â words and
  should satisfy for normal texts and all-day situtations. So these words should
  be learned first and be prefered.
  Glosa-English. All: glen.htm (HTML, 356Â kB), glen.txt (plain ASCII, 348Â kB).
  Only Centra: coglen.htm (100Â kB).
  English-Glosa. All: engl.htm (HTML, 372Â kB), engl.txt (plain ASCII, 364Â kB).
  The GID as "book" in pdf-format: gid.pdf (732Â kB, perhaps fitting for offline-
  reading or printing).


  The Central_list by the Glosa authors Ashby/Clark gives an English cognate to
  each GlosaÂ 1000Â word. So it affords an insight into the design of the Glosa
  words and makes vocabulary learning quite easy.

  Kevin Smith has some vocabulary stuff on his site www.qualitycode.com/glosa/
  index.html, mainly based on the files above, partly experimental. This site
  will probably be removed soon, so if the link is dead, please click here to see
  a copy.

  See below "Word_Kitchen" for more information about these files.
  And here there is also a little machine-translated list Glosa-Spanish of an
  older version of the GID. Translation-programs always cause funny nonsense, so
  this file could only be a base for future work, but please do not use it
  without the English version and not without thinking.
  Please prefer the English lists of GID above, if it is possible for you.
