## Glosa, short information

### Brevi info in English

There are many drafts of international auxiliary languages, but Glosa is the most advanced one with no grammatical endings on the words (linguists call that an "isolating" structure). It is designed by Ronald Clark and Wendy Ashby and goes back to Lancelot Hogben's Interglossa (1943).

From The Glosa Basic Reference (by Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby, 1994):

> Glosa is an artificial language intended for use among people with different native, cultural, or national languages. It is an auxiliary language and has no purpose of supplanting or replacing any other languages. Its purpose is only to be a common means of communication for people of different languages. Glosa has several distinguishing characteristics:
> - Its structure is very simple and based on semantics. It is an analytical language with no inflexions, genders, or diacritical marks. Glosa does have ways of forming plurals, tenses, questions, etc., similar to Chinese and Malay, which use a word for each idea, but no inflections. A small number of words handle grammatical relationships not otherwise provided for. Many Glosa words can serve as more than one part of speech as meaning and common sense allow. 
> - Glosa words are based on Latin and Greek roots common to the chief Euro-languages; via science, technology, and medicine, these words are penetrating all languages. Although a larger vocabulary is available, a base vocabulary of between 1000 and 2000 words handles most situations. 
> - Its pronunciation is simple and regular, and its spelling is phonetic. 
> - Above all, Glosa is neutral. Because it is no one's own language, it is available to everyone without jealousy or resentment over the dominance of any one or a few national languages. Its use of Latin and Greek roots, many of which are already in widespread use, gives it internationality.
