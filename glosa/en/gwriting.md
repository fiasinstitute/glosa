  - Be sure of the pronunciation: borrow a "How to Speak Italian"
    cassette from your library, for the five Italian vowel sounds; say
    words out loud - or in your head. Do NOT simply read Glosa words
    using English language pronunciation.
  - Aim to think in Glosa as soon as you possibly can: play with the
    Glosa words in your head, directly, rather than try to translate
    from your national language into Glosa.
  - Avoid thinking in national language idiom when marshalling ideas to
    express them in Glosa; and, in general, avoid, where possible, the
    metaphorical use of concepts. Glosa works best if you think about
    the ideas you are expressing, and use the \`\`right'' word to convey
    each concept.
  - Practice making short uncomplicated sentences, at first. Get the
    \`feel' of the language before launching out into literary prose.
  - Go for FLUENCY when you start: accuracy will come later, but a flow
    of language is better than a faultering , though correct, sentence.

\* What speeded up my Glosa most, was in attempting to use the language
to get the particular meaning I wanted. This happened when I attempted
to retell well-known children's stories in Glosa.

\* When writing a sentence aim for balance in your style and a good
sound in the words: a well written sentence should flow, and the
relationship of the parts of the sentence should be immediately apparent
to a reader.

\* Edit what you have written: it should look, feel and sound good. On
reading your Glosa sentence out aloud, it should sound good and remind
you of the thoughts that were in your mind when you wrote it.

\* When choosing words, to express your ideas, Glosa works best if you
avoid derivative and metphoric vocabulary, and select the actual root
words that express the particular idea.

\* Is it too much to say that, in Glosa, cliched thinking and national
language idiom are out? Such non-literal language varies from culture to
culture, and does not translate well; in the arena of global
communication cliche and idiom are just bad style. If non-literal
language cannot be avoided, it can be marked off using an agreed
convention, such as placing asterisks around it:

``` 
   e.g. Yesterday, it was raining cats and dogs, and we got wet through.
        Pa-di, u meteo pa pluvi *plu felis e plu kanis* e na pa gene
           kompleti ge-hidro.
```
