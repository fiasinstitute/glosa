The Glosa words are taken from Latin and Greek. So they are known to
many people by foreign words or by the Roman languages. A limitated
vocabulary (*Glosa 1000* or *Centra Glosa*), easy to learn for
beginners, should satisfy for all day situations. For higher demands
(science, art, poetry) an extension (*Glosa 6000* or *Mega Glosa*) is
available.

To offer a central vocabulary is a good idea and a strength of the Glosa
design. Unfortunately the many Glosa-1000-lists (you can find some of
them below) differ from each other. The Glosa Internet Dictionary (GID)
is a project, that tries to bring together all the existing vocabulary
material.

<p>The   <em>Glosa Internet Dictionary</em>   (GID)<br />
<br />
... is the largest dictionary available for Glosa. It is more comprehensive and has less errors than any printed list. It has three levels: Mega (Literary, large), Basi (Basic, middle) and Centra (Core, small). Mega contains all Basi words and Basi contains all Centra words. Centra has less than 2000 words and should satisfy for normal texts and all-day situtations. So these words should be learned first and be prefered.</p>

English-Glosa. All: <a href="engl.htm">engl.htm</a> (HTML, 372 kB), <a href="engl.txt">engl.txt</a> (plain ASCII, 364 kB).</p>
<p>The GID as "book" in pdf-format: <a href="gid.pdf">gid.pdf</a> (732 kB, perhaps fitting for offline-reading or printing).</p>

The [Central list](centra.htm) by the Glosa authors Ashby/Clark gives an
English cognate to each Glosa 1000 word. So it affords an insight into
the design of the Glosa words and makes vocabulary learning quite easy.

	

Kevin Smith has some vocabulary stuff on his site
[www.qualitycode.com/glosa/index.html](http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa/index.html),
mainly based on the files above, partly experimental. This site will
probably be removed soon, so if the link is dead, please click
[here](http://mysite.freeserve.com/glosa) to see a copy.

	
	

## Español/Castellano (Spanish) ![Español insignia](../pic/flagcastellano.png)

[Español-Glosa](esgl1k.htm)	
[Glosa-Español](gl1kes.htm)

See below ["Word Kitchen"](index.html#kitchen) for more information
about these files.

And here there is also a little machine-translated list
[Glosa-Spanish](gmcoglsp.htm) of an older version of the GID.
Translation-programs always cause funny nonsense, so this file could
only be a base for future work, but please do not use it without the
English version and not without thinking.

Please prefer the English lists of GID above, if it is possible for you.

	
	

## Deutsch (German) ![Deutsch insignia](../pic/flagdeutsch.png)

GID (only Centra-words) Glosa-English with German translation

## Italiano (Italian) ![Italiano insignia](../pic/flagitaliano.png)

Here there is a little machine-translated list

Translation-programs always cause funny nonsense, so this file could
only be a base for future work, but please do not use it without the
English version and not without thinking.

## The Word Kitchen

Only for specialists, nothing for people afraid of problems:

[gidhist.htm](gidhist.htm) with further information to the GID and its
history, [missing words](gidmiss.htm) (perhaps this file is not
up-to-date), [synonyms in Core](cosyn.htm) (perhaps this file is not
up-to-date), [Similar Synonyms](simsyn.htm) (with solution suggestions
of Glosa author Wendy Ashby), a ["Word Derivation Scheme"](gwds.htm).

	

Some changes have been made to the [Central list](centra.htm) (see
above). For those with historical interest the [original central
list](centrao.htm) could be found here.

	

**French**:	
The [French-Glosa](frgl1k.htm) list (see above "French") is from the
book "Français -Glosa 1000" by the Glosa authors Wendy Ashby and Ron
Clark themselves, but with some [corrections](frglcorr.htm).	
Only for historical interest, - please do not use it\! -: here you can
have a look at their old, original and uncorrected [French
list](frgl1ko.htm).	
The reversed list [Glosa-French](gl1kfr.htm) (see above "French") is
computer-generated from the corrected French-Glosa list. The book has no
Glosa-French list in it.

	

**Spanish**:	
The [Spanish-Glosa](esgl1k.htm) list (see above "Spanish") is from the
book "Español -Glosa 1000" by Richard Burrows and the Glosa authors
Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark themselves, but with some
[corrections](esglcorr.htm).	
Only for historical interest, - please do not use it\! -: here you can
have a look at their old, original and uncorrected [Spanish
list](esgl1ko.htm).	
The reversed list [Glosa-Spanish](gl1kes.htm) (see above "Spanish") is
computer-generated from the corrected Spanish-Glosa list. The book has
no Glosa-Spanish list in it.
