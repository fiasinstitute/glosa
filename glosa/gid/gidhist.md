-----

	From: William W Patterson
	Subject: advertisement, annul, beginning, belong, camera, discovery
	To: GLOSALIST
	Date: Sun, 10 Jan 99 11:3
	
	
	advertisement - PUBLIKO was suggested. My files say that PUBLIKO =
	"public" and PUBLIKA = "publish" (that old finalvowel problem
	again?). Since ADVERTI = "advertise" and "refer to", I suggest
	ADVERTI or ADVERTI-something. I prefer simply ADVERTI.
	
	annul - KANCELA was suggested but KANCELA = "lattice". Suggestions?
	
	beginning - PROTO and KOMENCE were suggested. I prefer KOMENCE because
	it meshes better with the other definitions of the words. There is
	also Glosa RUDIMENTA = "beginnings". If we consider "beginning" and
	"beginnings" to be close enough in meaning, we could use it.
	
	belong - HABITA was suggested. According to my files, HABITA = "dwell"
	or "inhabit". The old finalvowel problem again? Although I could
	almost make a case for this. Anyway, how about PERTINE which is
	already in the dictionary? ("Belong" should not have been in the
	omissions list. I think it got there through a programming or data
	formatting error.)
	
	camera - FOTO-GRAFI KAMERA was suggested, but KAMERA = "room". How about
	just FOTO-GRAFI-ME?
	
	discovery - DETEKTI was suggested, but since HEURESI = "discover", why
	don't we use it instead?

Subject: ismo, isti
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Sun, 10 Jan 99 11:2


Glosa "natio-ismo" was suggested for English "nationalism". However,
to my knowledge there is no Glosa "ismo" so "natio-ismo" cannot be a
compound; "-ismo" appears to function as a suffix but Glosa doesn't
do suffixes!

There are several Glosa words ending in "-isti". I'd thought of this
in the past and was going to suggest dropping those "-isti" forms and
just using "-pe", but when I bumped into the group of "-ismo" words I
thought, Hey, why not just create some new words to sort this out...

	ISMO = principle

	ISTI = specialist

What do you think?

From: William W Patterson
Subject: dress, engine, hasty, meter, liter, kingdom
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Sun, 10 Jan 99 11:3


dress - U VESTI works for a generic item of clothing, but how about one
	specifically for the item of clothing that women wear? Glosa seems to
	lack terms for several items of clothing, though it does have shoes,
	socks, capes and coats covered. Hmmm. Hogben wasn't a flasher, was he?

engine - MAKINA and DINA-ME were suggested. I prefer the latter.

hasty - TAKO was suggested but my files say that TAKO = "fast" or "swift",
	and that isn't quite the same thing. Suggestions?

kilometer - KILOMETRI was suggested. However, METRI = "measure" and
	METRA = "meter" or "metre" (one of those was missing and that's why
	it showed up in the omissions file).

And for consistency, I suggest that we add LITRA rather than LITER.

kingdom - REGI-LANDA was suggested, but considering the following words
	and wishing to embody the concept of kings and not just rulers, I'd
	prefer to work BASILI into it somehow. BASILI-LANDA?
	BASILI = king
	BASILIKA = palace
	BASILISA = queen

Subject: putrid, exclusive, acknowledge, brass, afternoon, compound, dictionary
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 99 23:2


putrid - We have SAPRO (decay, rot). That could also serve for "putrid".

exclusive - We have EXKLUDE (exclude) and could use it for this too.

acknowledge - How about REKOGNI (recognize)?

brass - CUPRI-ZINK was suggested, but we have KUPRA (copper), so KUPRA-ZINK?

afternoon - Since noon is MESO-DI (noon), how about PO-MESO-DI?

compound - KOMPOSITO (composite) could handle this meaning too.

dictionary - VERBI-BIBLI is good for the preferred word, since it
	compounds two Glosa roots. We also have LEXIKO and LEXIKON. I don't
	think we need DIKTIONARIA in addition to those three... hmmm... I
	*do* like the looks of it... okay, let's add it, for the literary
	dictionary! But I do think VERBI-BIBLI should be preferred.

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 99 23:2


label - I have NOMINA but not NIMA; how about NOMINA-BILETA?

likely - Rather than POSI (perhaps), how about PROBABILI (probable)?
	Seems more positive to me.

pride - TARQINI (haughty, proud). That one even *looks* proud to me!

proposal - PROPOSI (propose).

radio - RADIO was suggested, but we have RADIO (ray, spoke).

such - Here we find one of those Glosa oddities. We have U TALI (such -
	from Latin "talis") and TALI (heel - from Latin "talus"). One of
	these needs to be changed! Suggestions? Mine is to use TALU for heel.
	Not only because it retains the original vowel, but also because
	"such" has probably been used more often than "heel" in existing
	literature.

advice	- In my file I find ADVOKA = AD+VOKA (call). Instead, how about
	using KONCILIA (advise) also as a noun?

suggestion - Rather than SUGERE, couldn't we just use SUGESTI (suggest)
	as a noun?

unit - We already have UNITA (trait), so we need something else for "unit".

grateful - We have GRATIA so we don't need GRACE. (Somehow that sounds
	odd.) So, GRATIA-PLE.

jealousy - We have ZELOSO (jealous); could it stand also for "jealousy"?

metric - METRO SISTEMA was suggested, but I prefer METRA SISTEMA or
	METRI SISTEMA, since METRA = "metre" (the system with metres), and
	METRI = "measure" (the system of measures), and METRO = "mother".

mile - We can't use MILE because currently MILE=KILO=thousand.

conscience - AUTO-KRITIKI was suggested. I like that one! Currently we
	have KRITICI=criticize, but I'm not sure whether I prefer the C or K
	at the end. Preference, anybody?

Subject: supper, calculate, calculator, radio, television, and other tele-things
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Wed, 13 Jan 99 21:5


supper - We already have CENA (dinner). It could be used. Or we could add
	KENA, similar but different, more like the Latin, if we want to make
	the distinction.

calculate, calculator - We have SUMA (add,sum,total). We could use this word
	also for calulate, and calulcator could be SUMA-RU. Or SUMA-ME, similar
	to PUTA-ME for computer.

television - TELE-VIDE was suggested, and this reminded me of the "radio"
	question. And German. We have TELEFONA (telephone) (though "sound"
	is FONO; terminal vowels again). "Radio" could be a TELE-(hear,listen).
	Unfortunately, all the appropriate Glosa words begin with a vowel;
	TELE-AUDI, TELE-AKUSTI, TELE-ASKOLTA, and TELE-AUSKULTA seem awkward.
	Actually, TELE-DICE might be more appropriate for Glosa's "telephone",
	and then TELE-FONA could be radio; but that would be a terrible False
	Friend, wouldn't it? SONI is another Glosa word for "sound"; I'm
	thinking of this solution...

	TELEFONA = telephone (or TELEFONO)
	TELESONI = radio
	TELEVIDE = television

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Thu, 14 Jan 99 12:3


centimeter - CENTI-METRI was suggested, but we already have CENTI (hundred)
	and CENTIPEDI (centipede). We need a new word for "hundredth". Or a
	better solution would probably be to use CENTIMETRA, with CENTI=hundredth
	and HEKTO=hundred, as in the Metric System. And then we'd have HEKTOPEDI.
	The downside is that we'd be inconsistent with existing literature.

equitable - Oops! We already have JUSTI (fair (equitable)) and JUSTI (just
	(equitable)), but somehow never defined JUSTI (equitable)!

hemp - SATIVA was suggested, but we have SATIVU (cultivated), which reminded
	me that the "sativa" in "cannabis sativa" means "cultivated". How about
	KANABIS, from Latin "cannabis", instead?

keen - We have ALAKRI (brisk, crisp, eager)? Could we fit "keen" into here?

I think these two would work. As I recall, there were quite a few -ISMO
and -ISTI words in which the "suffix" has the appropriate meaning, and
only a very few exceptions. I'll take another look at those exceptions
and see if they would really be too much of a problem.

Agreed! I think we can safely synonymize ~detekti~ and ~heuresi~, with
~detekti~ being the preferred word and ~heuresi~ a literary alternative.

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 26 Jan 99 17:1


http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm

I've updated the dictionary files! Password, as before, is .
The new dictionaries incorporate the previously omitted words, some
typo fixes, a few new words added for consistency, some more words
from Glosa 1000 that weren't included in Glosa 6000 for some reason,
and suggestions from the glosalist.

The Core dictionary now contains 2356 definitions, consisting of 1884
unique Glosa words. It would probably make a good base for the 2.5K!

I've also uploaded some sourcy files this time. My main source file
(ges.txt) can be found in source.zip; it has a few special formatting
character codes, like splats (*) in front of preferred synonyms, and
is the file from which all the dictionary files are generated by my
makefile.

Two intermediate files (egc.txt and gec.txt), which are themselves the
sources for the Glosa-English and the English-Glosa Core dictionaries,
can be found in core.zip; they contain the same data, one wordpair per
line, "lang1word = lang2word", but one is sorted by Glosa words and the
other by English words. They are the final step before the pageformatting
is performed for the Core dictionaries, and may be of use in creation of
the 2.5K.

Oops, I was afraid that would happen! I'll have to clarify a bit more
on that page.

There are five dictionaries, the GE, EGL,EGB, EGC and GEC, of descending
size and complexity, and these are the ones that have hyperlinks in the
left-hand column of the table. Each dictionary is available as a regular
zipfile and as a self-extracting DOS program; pick one or the other. So
that's ten files for the five dictionaries. But you only need to download
five files, the .zips *or* the .exes, to get all five.

The GE and (EGL or EGB) make a nice pair, as do the EGC and the GEC.

The extra files mentioned, SOURCE.ZIP and CORE.ZIP, are source files for
developers. SOURCE.ZIP contains the master source file (GES.TXT); CORE.ZIP
contains two intermediate files which are derived from GES.TXT and formatted
pagewise to create the EGC and GEC.

General comment... for printing, the five dictionary files are your best
bet. But for searching and such, you should probably get SOURCE.ZIP, one
big file with everything in it, one Glosa/English wordpair per line!

Okay, so I'll use HEKTO = "hundred" and CENTI = "hundredth", though I'm
not completely comfortable with this because "100" seems such a fundamental
thing, counting and such, and we'll be inconsistent with *all* the Glosa
dictionaries that I've seen. But... I *do* think it's the right thing to do,
and at least *we* will be internally consistent!

I agree. I've added NIMA and NIMA-BILETA, with NOMINA as the preferred
synonym for "name".

The 6000 also has RADIA = "radiate", so this would make the dictionary
more consistent trailing-vowel-wise. But the 6000 I have doesn't have
"radio" at all, and making RADIO = "radio" would be an inconsistency
relative to the 6000, which currently kind of lumps together RADIA and
RADIO, neither of which has anything to do with radios.

I like that. I'll put "trait" with KARAKTERA and "unit" with UNITA, which
does make more sense. UNITA = "unit" also fits better with other UNI-words.
Don't know where that UNITA = "trait" came from, but it's right there in
my 6000 though it doesn't really fit.

I'd favor just dropping "mile" since it's only of use in, what, two?
countries, I think. And as you say, probably won't be of any use some
day.

Hey plu lojbanistani! Doesn't Lojban have a marker of some sort to show
that a word is borrowed from another language? We could have some such
marking word, possibly a generic, warning that the following word (or
phrase) may not mean what you might expect. Maybe this could handle
idioms too!

But I also noticed today that Glosa has no word for "thousandth". How
about MILI? Doesn't appear to conflict with anything else.

Some say that Esperanto is sexist because it uses -in- to make a feminine
noun from the masculine/epicene root. I say that *if* it is sexist, it is
so for a quite different reason: men must share the root with women in the
epicene and have no infix to call their own. Why should women enjoy such
preferential treatment?

Yes, that was slightly tongue in cheek.

But why did this come to mind? Well, the situation seems similar to me.
By omitting "mile", do we offend backwards (Shhh. I'm a US citizen, so I
can say that.) countries like the United States? Or would inclusion of
"mile" instead be preferential treatment for the US and such? I think the
latter.

The alternative would require, in fairness, unique words for units of all
systems. Maybe the omission of "mile" in the International Language will
help to drag the US, kicking and screaming, into the 18th century.

Cc: glosalist@lists.zeta.org.au

Ich entschuldige mich zum Schreiben dieser Notiz auf Englisch.
Ich kann Deutsch gut lesen aber ich habe kleine Erfahrung mit
Schreiben auf deutsch... und mein Glosa ist sehr rostig!

I've updated the Glosa dictionary files at

	http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm

There were only a few changes to the words themselves, some things we
talked about shortly after the last update, and I hadn't felt like doing
the whole update thing again so soon. The main change was that HEKTO
replaces CENTI for "hundred"; CENTI becomes "hundredth". This makes some
of the other words more consistent with each other...

	CENTI = hundredth
	CENTIMETRA = centimeter, centimetre

	HEKTO = hundred
	HEKTOPEDI = centipede

	MILI = thousandth
	MILIMETRA = millimeter, millimetre

Also for consistency...

	KARAKTERI = trait
	UNITA = unit

	NIMA = name
	NIMA-BILETA = label

	SUMA-ME = calculator

And the following were added...

	GE-LIMITA = exclusive

	PRANDIA = supper

	RADIA = radius

I also created a new dictionary file, the Glosa-English Basic Dictionary
(GEB), as requested by Marcel for help in his work. (Let me know if there
is anything else I can do to help.) And I added the new Glosa links to all
the cover pages. The password, as always: seleni.

	NOTES TO "CORE"-DICTIONARY

 OF THE GLOSA-INTERNET-DICTIONARY-PROJECT OF BILL PATTERSON AND OTHERS


	Marcel Springer, Hamburg, 2000-07-28 



0. Index

	1. General Note 
	2. Notes to Single Words 
	3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root 
	4. Problems for a German 
	5. Core and Glosa 1000 



1. General Note

	You can sort them as you want: bad words remain bad words.	The Glosa 
	vocabulary is inconsistent and unsystematical.	All its problems are 
	mentioned and discussed in glosalist already.	

	Main problems are the 
	- arbitrary, random ending vowels (difficult to learn) and 
	- having two source languages (Latin and ancient Greek). 

	New words should be created.	Marked (e. g. with an asterisk) as not 
	original Clark/Ashby/GEO-words, they should replace the bad words. 



2. Notes to Single Words

A list, only catchwords. Alphabetical order. 

2.1.	"anti-co" has in Literary-dictionary the meanings "but; however; 
	nevertheless; though".	Please give back the Glosa-1000 "sed" 
	for "but"! 
2.2.	"demi" (half) is French. Latin "semi" (or Greek "hemi") would be 
	better.	(Remember "U Lupus"-translation-discussion.) 
2.3.	"diptera" (fly) is the animal (the fly), to fly	is "peti" or 
	"vola".	"vola" is to be found under "flight". Perhaps write 
	"fly {the}" and "fly {to}". 
2.4.	"deskende" (descend) not necessary, instead simply: "skende 
	kata". 
2.5.	"eroti" (physical): error: must be "physical love". 
2.6.	"es" (to be) is missing. "onto" instead. Please take Glosa1000's 
	"es" again! 
2.7.	"kapita": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives German "Haupt" 
	(head, main..).	"Core" gives "cape". That could mean a "high 
	point of land going out into the sea" or a "sleeveless garment, 
	hanging from the shoulders".	The file "Glosa Basic Reference" 
	gives "kapota - bonnet", that would be a synonym to the second.	
	"kapota" is not in Literary-dictionary. 
2.8.	"ko{n}" wrongly sorted in. Must be treated like "kon" and/or like 
	"ko". 
2.9.	"kordiali - warm". Not the temperature is meant but an emotion 
	(Remember our "U Lupus"-translation-discussion. Cf. Latin "cor, 
	cordis" - heart).	It would be better to take "meso-termo - 
	warm" and for "kordiali" only "hearty".	
2.10. "krati-grega": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives for "Regierung" 
	(government) "krati".	So "krati" is enough, "krati-grega" is 
	not necessary.	
2.11. "krispa": Core gives "contract". Note: not the "treaty" is meant, 
	but to "make shorter; to curl". 
2.12. "kritiki-ra":	The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" says "kritici" is 
	enough for German "Kritik", so "kritiki" would be enough for 
	"criticism". 
2.13. "mali-dice": "curse" (German "fluchen") is not always "swear" 
	(German "schwören").	"I swear I love you." is not "mali".	
2.14. Regular comparison is necessary for an auxiliary language. So: 
	peiora - worse (schlechter) ==> ma mali 
	pesimi - worst (schlechtester, am schlechtesten) ==> maxi mali 
	optimi - best (bester, am besten) ==> maxi boni 
2.15. "satura" - rich: Latin "satur, satura saturum" is satisfied, 
	copious; better for "rich"/wealthy would be "pluto". 
2.16. "porta" (harbor) should be "portu", because "porta" is also 
	"door" and "to carry". 
	(cf. Latin: portus, portus m. - harbur, u-declination, so root 
	would be portu;	porta, portae f.	- door, a-declination, so root 
	would be porta; 
	portare	- carry, a-conjugation, so root 
	would be porta (too)) 
2.17. "positi": The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" gives German "Posten, 
	Stand" (post, place).	For "to put" would be better "loka". 
	"loka" is already in Core with "to lay" (see 3.xx). 
2.18. "repei" (reply): perhaps typing error, should be "repli". 
2.19. "vid-abili": Simpler and better would be "vide-abili".	If we 
	take "vid-abili", we should take also "aud-abili" instead of	
	"audi-abili" and	"honor-abili" instead "honora-abili". 
2.20. For English "first" Glosa has not only "prima" and "proto", but 
	also "mo" (in after-position!).	"mo {afterposition}" should be 
	supplement to Literary-dictionary, and be prefered for 
	Core-dictionary. 
2.21. Some words may not so necessary for a beginner's dictionary: 
	palpebra (eyelid) (see also 3.60)
	operkula (lid) (see also 3.60) 
	runi (rune) 
	Other examples could be found, discussed and eliminated.	This 
	will be shown by practical use of the dictionary.



3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root

The intention of the internet dictionary project was to get a 
beginner's dictionary without synonyms (words with same meaning). 

Nevertheless the list below shows synonyms of Core.	This results from 
English synonyms and computer sorting.	Some of the synonyms are 
"real", (you know the thesis "A language has NO synonyms."), others are 
at least so near together, that one of each pair should be removed from 
Core and move to a higher level dictionary ("Base" or "Literary").	A 
discussion how to treat each word will be necessary. 

More tricky is the problem of words with related meanings.	They have 
to go back to the same root, but a lot in Core do not.	It could not 
be, that we eliminate part-of-speech-markers in Glosa, and then related 
words, differing only in part-of-speech, have different roots, only to 
distinguish them.	Then an old-fashioned part-of-speech-marker-system 
would be better. 
(e. g. iloto (dirty) - adjective / tolo (dirt) - noun).	

Reading the list below, please keep in mind: 
- Sources for Glosa words's meanings are the Richmond lists (and there are 
	several different lists, so perhaps you have a list with other meanings) 
	and the meanings of the classical origins. 
- The author (me) is not a native English speaker.

4. Problems for a German

4.1 It is not easy to distinguish between:
	hekasto (each, every) / panto (all) / holo (hole) / 
	(G1000:) singu. 
4.2 The German does not distinguish: 
	ali (any) / uno (some) 
	... and an international auxiliary language MUST NOT do either!!! 



5. Core and Glosa 1000

The discussion in glosalist showed, that here there are two opinions:

The Glosa traditionalists (maybe Robin Gaskell, Nick Hempshall, Marcel 
Springer) think, Glosa-1000-words should be prefered. Otherwise the 
language would be damaged, the small group of Glosa-users would be 
splitted.	A text written with Core-dictionary could not be understood 
by a Glosa-1000-learner. 

Others (maybe Bill Patterson, Charles) say, Glosa 1000 does not really 
exist, because the several 1000-lists contradict each other. They 
think, to give Glosa the chance of becoming THE world language, the 
best synonym each must be chosen.	These best synonyms are not found 
by the taste of two language designers, but by systematical research, 
perhaps by comparison of several Romanic languages (Latin, Spain, 
Italian, French), other modern languages with many speakers (English, 
Russian, German) or other auxiliary language's design drafts (Ido, 
Novial, Occidental, Interlingua de IALA) or perhaps by a word 
derivation scheme (e. g. Peano's Interlingua/Latina sine Flexione). 

Perhaps a compromise between these two groups could be found. 

Below there is a list of words of Core-dictionary not in Glosa 1000. 

What can we do with it?
- The book "Central Glosa" contains the interesting word list 
	"English 5000 to Glosa 1000". It gives more than one meaning to one 
	Glosa word (should be 5000/1000=1). With this list some more of the 
	Core-words below could be expressed with Glosa 1000 words. 
- Some of the words below differ to 1000-words only in the ending 
	vowel.	The ending-vowel is a problem on its own (---> start a new 
	project). 
- Some of the words below may be in one Glosa-1000-list, but not in 
	mine.	The contradiction of GEO-word-lists is a problem on its own, 
	too.

Now the list: it shows Glosa-word,	Englisch meaning, (German meaning) 
(==> Glosa-1000-Wort)]: 

5.1.	absenti	absent (abwesend) ==> G1000: ab; ne ci; ne la
5.2.	abstrakti	abstract (abstrakt, Auszug, abstrahieren) 
5.3.	acikula	prickly (stachelig) 
5.4.	adagio	slow (langsam) ==> G1000: no-tako; lento 
5.5.	adeo	goodbye (Leb wohl!)	==> G1000: vale 
5.6.	adhesi	adhere, adhesive (kleben, klebrig) 
5.7.	adhesi-ma	paste (Kleister) ==> G1000: pasta 
5.8.	adinami	weak (weich) ==> G1000: no-resista; debili 
5.9.	adjace	local (örtlich) ==> G1000: lokali 
5.10.	adjusta	adjustment (Einstellung, Anordnung) 
5.11.	...
...

	(Stop, stop, stop.	You will kill me, if I would post the whole 
	list here.) 
...

5.895.	vultu	expression (Ausdruck) ==> G1000: dice klari; emotio 
5.896.	zeloso	jealous, jealousy (eifersüchtig, neidisch, Eifersucht, 
	Neid) 
5.897.	zemia	loss (Verlust) 
5.898.	zeo	boil (kochen, sieden) 
5.899.	zeugo	team (Team, Gruppe, Arbeitsgruppe, Mannschaft) 
	==> G1000: grega 
```

``` 


Well, yes, I know, it is silly, if I - with my low English skill - 
would maintain an English dictionary.	But because I criticized around 
a few days ago, I should not only talk.	And so I start.	...

A new Glosa dictionary is available. Please visit: 

 - Glosa-English: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.htm 
	or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.txt.gz 
 - English-Glosa: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.htm 
	or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.txt.gz 

What is it? 

* Source was Bill Patterson's internet dictionary "Literary" (or "Glosa 
	All"). 
* Now it is formatted as a HTML-file with click-click-index (gglen.htm) 
	and a plain ASCII-file for your personal formatting games.	
	Some internet browsers decode the GNU-zip contraction 
	automatically. 
* All three levels are in one file: 
	"Literary" is the source and it is completely contained. 
	Words from "Base"-dictionary (= all words without synonyms) are 
	marked with "+" (or "++"). 
	Words from "Core"-dictionary (= only most useful "Base"-words) are 
	marked with "++". 
	So a good overview of word preferences is given (although the 
	prefernces should change in advantage to Glosa 1000 in future). 
* New feature: 
	Glosa 1000 words are marked with "1". 
* To add the "1"-marks, I used the list "Glosa 1000 - English" from the 
	book "18 Steps to Fluency".	It has 1182 items.	(I know, there are 
	different lists of "Glosa 1000".	Even "English - Glosa 1000" in 
	the same book is not the same vocabulary.	I think, it does not 
	make much use to argue, wich list would be best for vocabulary 
	research.) 
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, 96 Glosa words have been found wich 
	have not been in "Literary" before (mainly ending vowel 
	differences).	They are now added.	The words are listed in the 
	file www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggehist.txt.gz.	
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, about 170 English meanings to Glosa 
	words have been found wich have not been in "Literary" before.	
	They are now added.	They are listed in .../ggehist.txt.gz, too. 
* As Wendy wanted, it is free available in WWW, but the source is 
	mentioned. 
* Only the Glosa-English file is worked on.	The English-Glosa is a 
	simple computer reverse.	So it will not be perfect. 
* Because I am stupid, new mistakes certainly were added.	Please find 
	them. 


What now? 

	The new file gives the possibility to access all Glosa words AND 
	to prefer Glosa 1000.	
	So, a text written with the internet dictionary can be understood by 
	a learner of printed vocabulary lists from Richmond.	Unfortunately 
	that was not so easy before. 
	
	Next step should be to supplement the list "English 5000 to 
	Glosa 1000" from the book "Central Glosa" to cover a (five times ?) 
	bigger meaning's field with the heart vocabulary. 

	Perhaps you have some suggestions how to do it.	I do not know a 
	way with satisfying effectivity.	As I wrote, my scanning and 
	OCR-text recognition failed (I tryed the program "Text Bridge 
	Pro 9.0").	Maybe you have more luck?	The "E5000G1000" has 
	51 pages.

| 2000: | Charles, William Patterson, Nick Hempshall, Marcel Springer supplement the Internet Dictionary with the list "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" from the book "Central Glosa". |

-----

	

2000-09-15: Marcel Springer to Glosalist:

	The Glosa Internet Dictionary has been updated. 
	
	
	Changes: 
	
	As I wrote, I changed the preferences of the synonyms ("++" and "+") in 
	advantage to Glosa-1000-words ("1").	Of course, with the English 
	meanings I could not really find all Glosa synonyms because of English 
	synonyms (like Bill before!). 
	
	Then, as Charles suggested (and later rejected), I took Paul's 
	Base-Vocabulary-list (ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary , 
	I used Charles's "mixed salad") and Rick Harrison's VITAL-list 
	(http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) and put the Glosa 
	words to these English words into the "Core"-dictionary.	Sometimes I 
	could not find a fitting Glosa word for the English in the Internet 
	Dictionary or I did not like the found word.	These missing words are 
	listed (www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm ).	Please have a look. 
	Perhaps you know good Glosa words for them. 
	
	Nick's comments (again thanks, follow-ups are welcome) have been built 
	in (Nearly all. I will ask some questions later). 
	
	A lot of error correcting and meaning harmonization is done.	All is 
	protocoled in www.tu-harburg.de/~smms/gidhist.txt.gz . 
	
	The new "Core"-dictionary has now 1991 Glosa items.	1761 of them are 
	Glosa-1000s (= 88 %).	Before it was 729/1941=38%. 
	The new "Basic"-dictionary has 4634, 2695 Glosa-1000s, 58 % 
	(before 965/5026=19%).	The whole Internet Dictionary has 8481 Glosa 
	items. 
	
	
	
	I tried hard to handle the data carefully and with respect to Bill, the 
	Richmonders and the spirit of Glosa. 
	
	Please visit, use, criticize and help:	... (URLs) 
	
	
	
	
	I believe, the "Core"-dictionary is quite useful now !!! 
	
	
	... but it is far away from being ready.	Here some tasks to do. 
	Some are small, some not: 
	
	* I feel not satisfyed with all of the 1705 " + "-words ("Basic"-words, 
	not in "Core" nor in Glosa-1000).	Suggestions and help are needed. 
	* There are English words in Paul's Base-Vocabulary-list 
	(ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary ) and in Rick 
	Harrison's VITAL-list (http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) 
	wich are not in the Internet Dictionary or they are there but I did 
	not like their Glosa word.	I listed these words in 
	www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm .	Good Glosa words for 
	them should be found - or created. 
	* The amount of words in "Core" and "Basic" should be optimized.	
	I think, maybe 1700 for "Core" and less than 4000, maybe 3700 for 
	"Basic" would be best. 
	* I have to go through Bill's mails to Glosalist about his dictionary 
	work and his considerations.	The mails are collected in 
	www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz .	Without wanting to, I 
	certainly have destroyed some good ideas when I used the Richmond 
	data.
	* The "G"s (marks of Glosa words with Greek origin) should be 
	supplemented with help of the book "Glosa 6000".	Same with 
	capitalization. 
	* Some synonyms are necessary for good style and feeling comfortable 
	with a language.	But in "Core" the amount of synonyms should be 
	reduced to a minimum.	Especially the phenomenon of "different roots 
	for similar concepts" is annoying.	I started to make a list of them 
	(www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gcosyn.htm ).	We could complete the 
	list and then fix this problem. 
	* Alphabetical sorting ("{", "}", "[", "]") must be corrected. 
	* The problem of "similar synonyms" (similar Glosa words with same 
	meaning, mostly differing from each other only in the ending vowel) 
	is not solved.	I started to make a list of them 
	(www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ).	The list should be 
	completed.	We can build up a database of classical origins to every 
	word (word pair) and of cognated words in other languages.	
	With this data we could collect examples to every Latin and 
	Greek conjugation/declination and write a "Word Derivation Scheme". 
	A start for such a scheme is www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gwds.htm 
	(it is just what I emailed before here in Glosalist). 
	With this scheme we can choose the "right" synonym or "correct" the 
	words.	Great would be an approval by Wendy Ashby. 
	* A database of classical origins and cognated words of other 
	languages should be made for the "Core"-words, too.	With the 
	"Word Derivation Scheme" we could systematize the vocabulary then 
	step by step.	
	
	And of course:
	* Correct errors!
	* Contact W. Ashby!
	* Test out the dictionary by conversation and translation work!
	* Translate the dictionary into various languages (German, Russian, 
	French ..)!

| 2002-04-06: | A letter from Wendy Ashby |

``` 
(Marcel asked, 2002-03-12:)
MS: Qo es Glosa verba pro "culture"?	Posi "kultura"?
(Wendy Ashby answered, her letter from 2002-03-23:)
WA: culture = kultura
(Changes, I made in the dictionary, updated version from 2002-04-10:)
--> "kultura +	culture" item added.

MS: Qo es Glosa verba pro "compliment"?	Posi 1000-verba "lauda", alo
	"komplimenta"?
WA: compliment = lauda 1000, komplimenta 6000.
--> "lauda 1++	applaud; approval; approve; pay tribute to; praise" 
	added meaning "compliment {admiration}". 
	"komplimenta	compliment {admiration}; compliment {greetings}" item 
	added. 
	"saluta 1++	greet; greeting; salute; yours truly" added meaning 
	"compliment {greetings}".

	something [feel ]" item added. 

MS: "fusi" semani "pour" e "spindle".	Posi na pote muta id a
	"fuso - spindle" (Latino "fusus"), te alexi bi semani pro mo verba
	(homonym).	Alo posi tu ski u Glosa-1000-verba pro "spindle", posi
	"fi-gira-ru"?
WA: pour = fusi 1000.
	spindle = gira-baci 1000 alo fi-gira-baci.
	fusi "6000".
--> "gira-baci 1	spindle" item added. 
	"fi-gira-baci 1	spindle" item added. 
	"fusi	spindle" added "{=(fi-)gira-baci} X". 

MS: "stremato" in bibli "Glosa 6000", pagina 123, semani "a twist,

	twisted, posi ma-boni "ge-strepto ra" alo ...?); qi pan feno habe

WA: stremato = Greek twist, turn, wrench.

	twist" changed "stress" to "stress {caused by torsion}", added

	To desert = ki ab/ fugi ab/ abandoni.

	"top (spinning toy)" e ne "top (highest point)".	Qe mi es veri?
	Qo verba debi gene prefere, "strobo" alo "strombi"?
WA: stobo + strombi = top (gira ludi-ra)
	top = akro (top of mountain)
	strombi = Greek "koni", English "cone". (stromboid, strombiform)
--> (Certainly error of Wendy, should be "strobo".	"strombi" should 
	be prefered, because it has more cognates in English.) 
	"strobo G	whirl; cone; top {spinning toy}" added "{prefer 
	strombi}". 
	"akro 1++G	end; peak; summit; tip; tip {top}; top {highest point}"

	pagina 94.	Qe id es tali?
WA: bari = Latin
	gravi = Greek
	Both mean "heavy, important, heavy, grave, impressive".
--> (Certainly error of Wendy, bari is Greek, gravi Latin.) 
	"bari 1++G	heavy" changed "1++G" to "1+G", added meanings 
	"important; grave {serious}; impressive". 
	"bari-ma 1*	matter" item removed. 
	"gravi-ma {=bari-ma} 1X	matter" removed "{=bari-ma}" and "X". 
	"gravi 1++	especially; grave {serious}; important; serious; heavy"

| 2002-12-19: | Questions to and answers from Wendy Ashby |

Here there are some questions Marcel Springer asked Wendy Ashby and her
answers. Marcel's letter was from May the 5th and her from June the 3rd.
The questions mainly belong to Glosalist discussions in the first half
of the year 2002.

``` 
sto

Mi pa diskusi ko Nick Hempshall de frase
	"Mi ne pote ne ridi - I couldn't help laughing".
Nick pa ma amo "Mi ne pote sto-se ridi"; kausa an ne amo bi "ne" in mo
frase.
Mi pa doxo; id habe difere
	"couldn't help" = "couldn't suppress" = "alexi proto"
e
	"sto" = "stop" = "fini" ridi.
Po-co Nick grafo; "sto - suppress; prevent" es in inter-reti
verba-lista.	E an habe veri.	Plu-ci semani veni ex bibli
"Central Glosa":	"sto - suppress" p. 119, e "sto - prevent" p. 108.
Mi doxo; "sto - suppress, prevent" ne es boni.	Id sio es ma boni; si
na sio habe "suppress" = supresi alo 1000 alexi e
"prevent" - preventi, profilakti alo 1000 kura pre e
"sto" solo "stop, halt, ...". Qe, tu doxo qo-ra?

WA: "mi ne pote sto se ridi" es in Interglossa e "18 Steps".
	Alexi es "protect, defend".	Posi ne gru ci.
	Si tu ne amo "sto" posi tu ma amo:
	"tena se" = restrain myself
	alo "resista se" = resist myself.

[I understood, that "sto" does not make a difference, whether the
action to be stopped or prevented has already started or not.
Supplemented in Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"resista se 1	resist oneself" item added. 
"tena se 1	restrain oneself" item added.]

orange

"orange": qe id semani solo u frukti alo plus kroma "rubi-xanto"?

WA: "orange" in Interglossa e Glosa 6000 = frukti e kroma.
	Hogben pa grafo "mi elekti orange kausa de id lati internatio uti
	in komerci."
	Glosa 1000 = kroma es "rubi-xanto".

[In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"orange {French} 1++	orange {fruit}" unchanged. 
"rubi-xanto 1++	orange {colour}" unchanged. 
"orange {French}	orange {colour}" item added.]

kamera

"kamera": qe id semani solo "room" alo plus fotografi-me?

WA: Fotografo-me + kamera = camera.
	Plu proto fotografi-me pa es "pusi kamera".

[Typical: one line fotografO-me, then fotografI-me. 
-i is prefereable, because photography is an international word. 
In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"fotografi-me 1+*	camera {apparatus}" removed "*".
"kamera 1++	accomodate; apartment; camera {room}; chamber; hall; room" 
	added meaning "camera {apparatus}".]

valid

Qo es Glosa verba pro "valid"?

WA: validi = valid, strong, sound.

[In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"validi +	sound {well}; strong" added meaning "valid".]

solidarity

Qo es Glosa verba pro "solidarity" e "solidary"?	Qe, posi "solidari"
alo in 1000 simpli "akorda"?

WA: Pende ex kontextu, exampla: tu pote uti
	komuni akorda
	lega akorda, etc.

	Solidarity es Français lexi.	Itera kontextu es gravi.
	Plu exempla:
	komuni akti
	kon ergo
	ergo kon alelo ko komuni fide

[Unfortunately no direct "solidarity". 
In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"komuni akorda	solidarity; solidary" item added. 
"lega akorda	solidarity; solidary" item added. 
"komuni akti	solidarity; solidary" item added. 
"kon ergo	solidarity; solidary" item added. 
"komuni fide	solidarity; solidary" item added.]

| 2002-11-02: | A letter from Wendy Ashby |

``` 
(Marcel asked, 2003-08-11:)
MS: U Glosa verba "praxi" habe in GID: 
	"praxi 1++	practice; practise; sensible; shrewd", 
	e in Español-bibli:
	"actuar" (actuate) and "hacer" (do; make).	
	Mi este; "sensible" (ex bibli Central Glosa, p. 114) e "shrewd"
	(Central Glosa, p. 115) feno komika.	Mi sio prefere "sensi" e
	"intelige" pro mu.	

(Wendy Ashby answered, her letter from 2003-09-07:) 
WA: PRAXI Greek - do, cause, effect, doing, 
	acting, busy, able, effective 
	to experience resulting from practice. 
	Español one form of hacer+actuar= Glosa praxi. 

	English "shrewd" can be PRAXI, to act or to think resulting from
	practice or cunning. 

	cunning can also be STRATEGI or INTELIGI. 

(Changes, I made in the dictionary, 2002-11-02:)
--> 
"praxi 1++	practice; practise; actuate; do; make" added meanings
	"effect {v}; effective; doing; act; acting; busy; able; experience
	{v, resulting from practice}; sensible {resulting from practice};
	shrewd {resulting from practice}". 
"praxi {prefer sensi or intelige} 1	sensible; shrewd" item deleted. 
"efekti 1++	effect" changed meaning to "effect {n}; effect {v}". 
"seqe 1++	follow; consequence; effect; following; next; outcome;
	result; sequence; sequential; subsequent" changed "effect" to
	"effect {n}". 
"seqe [u ] 1++	following; next" removed "++". 
"experi 1++	experience" changed meaning to "experience {n};
	experience {v}". 
"strategi 1++G	strategy; trick; cleverness; cunning; foxiness;
	shrewdness; trap {trick}" added meaning "shrewd". 
"intelige 1++	intelligent; shrewd" added meaning "cunning" as second
	meaning (Certainly an error of Wendy: intelige not inteligi). 


MS: Qe, mi pa logi korekti: "basi" e "baso" es difere verba?	GID
	habe:	
	"basi 1++G	base; basis; found {v}; grounds" 
	e ex Español-bibli: "proof" (evidencia) e "reason" (base
	{razones}; razones), 
	"baso 1++	bottom; low; lower {v}"
	e ex Español-bibli: "soil; ground; on the ground" (bajo;
	(en el) suelo).	

WA: BASI	= Greek + is Central 1000 = grounds, reason. 
	FUNDA = Latin + is Central 1000 = bottom 
	BASO	= Latin, Glosa 6000: that on which one steps, foundation,
	bottom, base, basis.	This is not in "C. 1000" as will
	cause confusion with G. BASI. 

--> 
"basi 1++G	grounds; reason {n}; base; basis; found {v}; proof"
	remains. 
"funda 1++	bottom; base; depth; foot {lowest part}; found {v};
	ground" added meaning "foundation", first meanings "bottom; found
	{v}". 
"baso 1++	bottom; ground; ground [on the ]; low; lower {v}; soil"
	added meanings "base; basis; foundation", first meaning stays
	"bottom", removed "++".
