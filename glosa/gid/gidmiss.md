title: Glosa, - Missing Words

As Charles suggested (and later rejected), I took Paul's
Base-Vocabulary-list (
<ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary>, I used Charles's
"mixed salad") and Rick Harrison's VITAL-list (
<http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html>) and put the Glosa
words to these English words into the "Core"-dictionary. Sometimes I
could not find a fitting Glosa word for the English in the Internet
Dictionary or I did not like the found word. These missing words are
listed here. Please have a look. Perhaps you know good Glosa words for
them.

	

## "Paul":

### Affixes:

\-able, -al, -an, -ance, -ar, -ate, -ation, -en, -ence, -er, -ery, -ess,
