 This site is maintained by the linguists of the  Committee on language planning, [FIAS](https://fias.fr). Its aim is to document  the Interglossa  language template  and its main implementation the constructed language Glosa. The use of this language(s) steadily declining,  an open source archiving procedure of their materials and documentation appears particularly desirable.
