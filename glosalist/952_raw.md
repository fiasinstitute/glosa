I'm sure that many of you have noticed that Glosa uses elision; it 
drops t=
he last vowel of some "verbs" when it is followed by another 
vowel or h co=
nsonant in the next word: 
- dona --> Fe pa don_ a mi plu-ci kali flori (Sh=
e gave me these 
beautiful flowers) 
- dice --> Qe tu pote dic_ a mi u via =
a...? (Can you tell me the way 
to...?) 
- komence --> Komenc_ u mega no-fa=
cili minus fobo. (Take the bull by 
the horns) 
They are not limited to the=
 verb forms: 
- proxi --> Prox_ u-ci es u pedi-kruci. (Near this is a cross=
walk) 
- bileta --> Pro qo tem u-ci bilet_ habe valu? (For how long is this=
 
ticket valid?) 
Some times it is not followed by any vowel or word: 
- do=
mi --> u no-kali dom_. (an ugly building) 
Even some other times a vowel is=
 not deleted but added: 
- sub --> u subO kali flori. (a rather lovely flow=
er) 
However, if you apply this rule to some other words it could be a 
pro=
blem: 
- sti --> st_ u lampa (turn o_ the lamp) 
- sto --> st_ u lampa (tur=
n o__ the lamp) 
- ki --> mi k_ ana (I g_ up) 
These rules (I consider as a=
 kind of inflections) seem (not sure) to 
apply only to some words (irregul=
ar) and of those not all the time 
(irregular?). I recommend that you would=
 eliminate this feature from 
the standard statements or documents (less ru=
les). Exceptions may 
perhaps apply for poetry, play, slang, etc. Thank you=
.
