i think i.ve made a wiki page called sydglosa - but as ever i am slightly  
confused - on it i have started a short story translated from the english of my  
first wife who died about 20 years ago . i shall add to it, so far it is very 
 utility fancy bits may follow. could you let me know whether is has come 
through  or not and i shall add more to it?. can i do another separate page with 
my  musing about glosa grama etc?
what's a blog? by the way
syd
