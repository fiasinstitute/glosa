Plu Glosa ami-

Yes, MI DESIRA ES FORTI, is ambiguous as far as grammar is =
concerned.

Is DESIRA a noun, or is it a verb taking ES as its infinitive? =
Is MI
the subject, or MI DESIRA the subject?

Ian's examples

1. Mi desira =
es; mi es forti.
2. Mi habe u forti desira.

do clarify things. Xavi's

'U =
mi desira es forti,'

is also possible but could also mean, "Mine desires t=
o be strong."

Another possibility would be to add NU before the verb:

MI =
NU DESIRA ES FORTI.

MI DESIRA NU ES FORTI.

I'm really not worried about t=
he grammar here because- as in any
natural language- context would make the=
 grammar- and even more
importantly the meaning- clear:

MI ES DEBILI. MI D=
ESIRA ES FORTI.

MI DESIRA ES FORTI; ANTI-CO MI ESTE ZERO DESIRA DE FE PA-T=
EM.

To further complicate things, Hogben would insist:

I desire to be str=
ong. =3D
MI DESIRA *HABE* FORTI.

For some reason, he thought this construc=
tion was more logical. He
insisted (and this construction is found in some =
natural languages):

MI DESIRA ES FORTI. =3D
I desire to be strength.

Clea=
r as mud? Just use the context, that is, the words around the
word, rather =
than grammar. Words explain things much more accurately
than grammar ever c=
an- and you don't have to be a linguist to use
words.
