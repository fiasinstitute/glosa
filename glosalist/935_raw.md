Thank you very much for the encouragement. I really appreciate it. 
It is s=
o hard to escape the societal rut. As for Glosa, here is one 
of my wishes:=
 
 
I feel that it's really unfortunate that "j" was decided to 
represent =
"y" sound. Perhaps it is good for people of some languages 
and that it fol=
lows ipa, but we are now missing a very common sound, 
"jay". I recommend t=
hat you would reinstate the "jay" sound for "j"; 
most "j words" can remain=
 the same, just change the pronunciation; a 
few might have to be converted=
 to "y", such as "ya".  
 
It is never too late to change, especially in th=
ese relatively early 
stages if you so believe in your heart; it might actu=
ally make it 
easier to learn the words (it turns out that it may be better=
 for 
anglophone ;-); else, it may impact many, many generations to come. 
=
Do not make similar awkward mistake as "h" in some languages. Thank 
you. 
=
 
PS: Is there an FAQ for Glosa?
