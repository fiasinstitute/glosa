*  Hello in English to all on this List.
   Were I to wrote in Glosa, woould Roberto read and understand it?

   I think we all know the general theory that adoption of an IAL would
bring humanity into one community.  Though, I still don't know if global
power brokers would like this; and I suspect not.

   Have spent (wasted?) many years discussing Comparative Interlanguage on
various Lists - particularly Conlang - and conclude that the proponents of
the various possible interlanguages can never reach agreement among
themselves on the process by which a Lingua Munda is chosen .. or created
.. I continue to promote the language that my personal psychology suggests
to be the most suitable of those now on offer.

   I would promote a play-off between the most likely interlanguages, but
only if it was based on proper educational research principles, and only if
it involved a test instrument that objectively measured the achievement of
learners' communication over a fixed period of time.
   Sorry Roberto, I am all argued out.  At 66, if I am to do any good for
human global communication, it will be through the promotion of Glosa - not
through a detailed comparison of the various contenders.

   My objective is to give my energies to making Glosa ready for such an
educational research project .. not to dissipate them in further endless
discussion that leads to no conclusion, and which cannot result in a new
super-language through a melding of the best qualities of all of the
interlanguages.

   So, basically, Roberto, though it can be said that ...
> Ido carries 
>forward where Esperanto left off
             ... what has any of that to do with this very Glosalist?

>Those who have experienced Ido know how good it is being able to 
>concentrate on what you want to say and not having to think, at the 
>same time, about how you have to say it.

*   And, while this is probably so for someone who has developed fluency in
Ido, it will probably be so, also - if not moreso - for somebody who
develops fluency in Glosa.
    Be it known that this Glosalist is set up expressly for the purpose of
raising Glosa to the level of a completed language, with standard text
books of its own and communities of speakers of its own.
    Owing to history, the older Espernto and Ido have a head start: Glosa
needs to work faster, not slower, to make up for this historical time
differential; and thus, there really is no time available for Comparative
Interlinguistics on this List.  Were Glosalistas to be lured away to Ido,
it should have happened by now. 
    I would like to say that I urge people who are looking into Glosa to
apply themselves .. on this Mail List .. directly to the question of
completing Glosa as an international offering.  For those energetic souls
wishing to compare and contrast Glosa with other interlanguages, I would
urge you to do so on other Mailing Lists.  Of course, like all languages,
Glosa is not perfect; so, for the express purpose of improving it, lessons
can be learnt from the experience of other, mainly earlier, interlanguages,
and such discussion can be useful.  However, with the Hogben, Clark/Ashby
and Glosalist developments, the basic criteria of the language are near
completion, if not already there.  Thus, I envisage little benefit from
comparative methods, and major breakthroughs from the setting up of a total
language experience. This suggests the urgency of establishing a
speaking/writing community and the creation of dictionaries, early reader
books, and a range of instructional material. 

    With apologies again for writing, here, in English.  However, while
conceptual communication, like the above, is possible in Glosa now, it
would take a while to write, and only a few would persevere to read it.

    So, na sio uti na tem ko ma avantage per grafo e lekto uti Glosa.

*   To continue with Roberto's post:-
    Read Roberto's sentences, and imagine the word "Glosa" going in where
he has written Ido.
    If we create this projection .. and set about realising it, then
Roberto's contribution, here, will not have been wasted:-
%
>So much for the theory, but how does it work in practice? 
>International gatherings of people who speak Ido have taken place in 
>a number of countries and have demonstrated that the idea really 
>works in practice.

>Juste's La Serchado). There is a new world waiting to be discovered 
>by anyone who makes the small effort required to understand this 
>remarkable language.

*   However, while I know that using Glosa must be fun, I have given up the
idea of disadvantaging the language by relegating it to "hobby" status:-
>Using the language is a hobby in itself of course, as well as a way 
>of contributing to better understanding in the world.
    Maybe so, but I suggest that there really ought be a greater sense of
urgence about the project.  Having Glosa as a hobby is quite a legitimate
idea, but if all on the List adopt this approach, the Clark dream will
continue to remain unfulfilled.

Saluta,
