hurei!!  glosalist in glosa!
the more glosa there is to read and the more often we read it, the more we 
shall be able to think in it.

returning from 3 weeks of wild, wet, windy weather in the western wilderness 
of scotland, my first e-mail was from "drought-breaker"!

sometimes find G reading hard to understand and writing hard to do - partly 
because of memory etc problems (O2) but partly because of some very curious 
syntaxes in G itself. so this is in english.

shall contribute a story about Roberti ........
