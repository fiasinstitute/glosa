time seems to be very important and the arrangement of midflow parts seems to 
govern how a sentence is built. we have earlyflow->midflow->lateflow or 
lateflow<-midflowreversed<-earlyflow with some way of indicating reverse.

in 3 and 4,we have reverseflow. lateflow and earlyflow are exchanged but in 
the english and glosa the midflow becomes rather complex whereas the esperanto 
midflo is left in its simple form - points in favour of esperanto and against  
the other two languages. the simple form has an additional advantage; in 
english we read 'grass# and assume that we have earlyflow, we read the comlex 
midflow and find we have to revise our assumption to lateflow.in esperanto we know 
immediately that the flow direction has been reversed. 
a cerain amount of brain buzzing has led to a further rethink so I shall 
leave this as it is and the rethink will follow .......
