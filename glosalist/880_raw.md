you're very brave to do a programme from very very irregular english (or  
fairly so  german) to not completely regular glosa - i should like to  see a  
result or two of the glosa produced - nevertheless i think i'll  stick to my e to 
bridge to g - i've been awol investigating the algebra and  geometry of 
perspective but hope to be back in the fold before long - hope you  had pleasant 
christmas  etc and will have happy new year
