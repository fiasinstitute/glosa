Stephan-

So far the Glosa authors have taken a different attitude toward t=
he
last vowels of words. They have said:

1) Since the last vowel of the wo=
rd is simply there to ease
pronunciation, it is not important (except for a=
 few words such as
HOMO/HOMI, AMO/AMI). Therefore the words NOKTU, NOKTE, N=
OKTO should
all be understood as "night" to a Glosist.

2) The vocabulary o=
f Interlingua is also useful for use in Glosa. This
again shows a lot of fr=
eedom in picking the last vowel.

So you see the attitude is actually towar=
d allowing a variety of word
endings, rather than narrowing the endings to =
just one. I don't think
they would care if you used many of the word ending=
s you proposed.

Saluta,
