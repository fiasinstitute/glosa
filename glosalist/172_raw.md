Roberti was written a few years ago when I was decidedly vague about Glosa 
syntax so there will be plenty of things to criticise - I plead not guilty as 
grammar was a nasty word in those days. Glosa is often difficult to read because 
we have not really grasped the grammar nettle. 
when I was looking at episode 2 of Gary's captain bligh, I accidentally 
pfessed "delete" and lost the Glosa. Would Garry repeat it for me?
