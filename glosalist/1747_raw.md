Thanks a lot for the encouragement and the suggestions, Gary.  That means =
a lot to me!  I'll follow up with Marcel about the Glosa Wiki.  By the way,=
 I was recently trying to translate "hover" (in the sense of "the hummingbi=
rd hovered in the air next to the rose bush") into Core Glosa, but I couldn=
't figure out how to do this.  Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks,
Ian

Ian--

=
You're doing great in Glosa! You must be getting close to fluent.

A couple=
 notes on "Agri-pe e Cikonia":

ASPERGE is a fine Glosa word, but IF you wa=
nt to keep the vocabulary
smaller, "an nu-pa asperge per plu sperma" could =
be translated "an nu-pa
bali plu sperma peri agri."

RUPTI means "break" as=
 a "15 minute break at work." FRAKTI would be
better here.

It has been a l=
ong time since anyone used the Glosa Wiki, but perhaps you
could contact Ma=
rcel, marcel@..., and get the password from him,
and add some of your=
 translations to it.

Saluta,
