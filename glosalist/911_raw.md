Fredrick Bodmer in his book The Loom of Language writes:

The most importan=
t [practical suggestion] is to concentrate on learning 
a relatively small =
class of words before trying to learn any others. 
This class includes part=
icles, pronouns, pointer words and helper 
verbs. There are several reasons=
 for doing this. One is that a battery 
of about one hundred and fifty such=
 words for ready use, supplemented 
by a nodding acquaintance with about a =
hundred other, includes a very 
high proportion of the words we constantly =
use and constantly meet on 
the printed page.
