**  Firstly Folks,
    I feel that such linguistic discussion might play a smaller role in the
Glosa saga, nowadays, considering that the dictionaries and GID have been
around for a while, and perhaps it is time to concentrate on upgrading
newcomers.
    May be there is one word that is the right word for a concept, or
perhaps there are alternatives.  I could live with the "alternatives" idea,
as long as both are listed in dictionaries such that people can choose
either of them.  And eventually, by usage one or the other will prove more
popular.
    I remember raising the "in"/"into" | ~intra~/~in~ confusion with Ron
all those years ago, and he simply stated that that was just the way it was
in Latin.  But, with all the water that has flowed under the bridge since
then, this is just a bit of ancient history about 'Old Glosa' now.

    Unless a hard and fast rule about usage is made to cover cases:-
   the milk is in the glass
   pour the milk into the glass
   we don't want that inside the house
   move it into the inside of the jar
   go inside (the house)
   go into the house
   after skinning the carcase remove the insides
there could be a period during which a range of usages is extant.

While _Glosa 6000_,1992 p93,94 lists,    IN in,into
                                         INTRA inside

the GID Eng.->Glosa, 2001-12-30 lists,
  in       in 1++
  inside   endo (prefer intra) G; eso (prefer intra) G; intra 1++
  into     ad-in 1++; in 1++
 
So, until enterprising  glosa-pe  write definitive, no-synonym
dictionaries, and create rule-stating, instructional manuals, in which
simplifications teach just one usage per concept, we would probably be
better off to accept the present latitude in the published dictionaries and
word lists - and concentrate on the development of a corpus of Glosa texts.
 Needless to say, such texts could readily be edited, retrospectively, to
bring them into line with subsequently agreed standardisations.

**  Agreed, there does appear to be a multiplication of English-language
concepts now within the word, "type", and this multiplicity of meanings has
flowed over into the Glosa word, ~tipo~.  However, by seeing the idea of
metaphor at work here, we have a lot more ways, nowadays, of imprinting a
mark onto a surface .. than did the ancient Greeks .. and we could even say
we "type" a picture from our computer screen onto the paper in the attached
computer-printer.  And if things are all of the same type, we can
metaphorically say they are stamped out using the same mould; alternatively
if there are different types of the same thing, we can see the analogy with
different 'fonts' of 'typeface.'
    And my small dictionary of Modern Greek transliterates from the Greek:-
     type [taip]
     typical [tipicel]
     tipify [tipifai]
     typing [taiping]

    Possibly Nick and I are approaching the same thing from different ends.
 But I feel the main thought should be how we  accomodate, in the modern
language, Glosa, what has become of the concept, which originated with the
Ancient Greek root, [taip].

**  Yes, there might be better concept/words to convey some of the
peripheral modern English words that are part of the current spread of the
original Greek root, 'taip.'  But in the above example I was simply
attempting to show the possible breadth of usage of the Glosa word, ~tipo~.

**  So, having this level of variability within the concept of "in-ness"
can we say Glosa is stable enough for general use, or must further
standardisation occur before people can meaningfully tell stories using the
language? 
    If the general feeling - on this List - is that clear, unambiguous
translations, with no synonyms, must be decided upon before the language is
properly usable, then how is a decision to be reached?
    Is Wendy Ashby's decision to be final?

Saluta,
