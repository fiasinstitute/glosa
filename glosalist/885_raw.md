Boni Di,
It is actually Tom, the Hal Jordan was a fake name, I put up as a =

joke. (it's Green Lantern's secret identity). 

The file was easy enough t=
o convert. SuperMemo uses a text file 
format and then a conversion utility=
. So, I will have that ready here 
in a few minutes if anyone else needs it=
.

But this list is the best to start with? I have noticed a few 
different=
 versions. even occasionally differences in the same site 
and same documen=
t.

I have been interested in IALs for several years and have studied 
serv=
eral and of course tinkered with my own ideas... (admit it, you 
all have a=
 drawer full of notes on your our superlanguage somewhere, 
don't you?) I t=
hink that Glosa has the most promise and best ideas 
for an IAL. I'd like t=
o help promote it and get it out there. 

Is there a central group or perso=
n now? What kind of (or is there 
any) organization is there?

Well I look =
forward to getting involved and hopefully being of some 
kind of use.

Salu=
ta,

Tom
