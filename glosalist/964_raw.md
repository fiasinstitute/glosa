Would it not be a good idea to make a list of the
suggestions for Glosa? Then we could proceed to either
present them all to the governing body that is or to create
a committee to evaluate these ideas?  

I feel Glosa has the most promise of all the Constructed
languages out there, and would be very happy to lend and
efforts I have to promoting it.

I need to work on my fluency a great deal. I think a email
course, similar to the one that is available to beginning
Esperanto speakers, would be a huge benefit. of course it
would require a dedicated and fluent group of instructors.
We could test it here on the list with the more experienced
members helping the newer ones.  ( i think i can get the
link to the examples, if not a web search (esperanto,
email, course) should locate it.

And I do have some ideas about changes I would like to
implement that I have mentioned a few times as well.


Thanks,
Tom
