Well, the universal grammar stuff is a bit elusive, and for me it is not 
completely clear what does it means. Anyway, as far as I know, some researchers 
have suggested that maybe the creole languages could have something to do with 
this universal grammar.

This is based on the observation that most of these creole languages have very 
similar, almost identical, rules (or grammar, or syntax, or whatever you choose 
to call this), independently on what languages are they based on. And anyway 
this is a really remarkable fact that must have some underlying reason.

In this sense Glosa does the job pretty well, since it pretends to be a sort of 
creole (ok, maybe I misunderstood the point). Of course for this to be true, 
Glosa should accept some flexibilities, like the double negation, that is 
present in all creole languages. But it's very near the point, I think.
