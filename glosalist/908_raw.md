Ave plu ami de Glosa,

on the web edition of the book most errors are corre=
cted. I don't its
blashphemous to point out that "18 steps" have small erro=
rs. It is the
interest of all learners. The "18 steps" website for example =
is much
better for learning than all sites known to me for learning such "b=
ig"
IAL like Interlingua and Interlingue.

I like Tom's idea to create some=
 new multimedia edition for learning
Glosa like the one for Esperanto. That=
 would really a great thing for
the promotion of Glosa.

Plu saluta
Doro
