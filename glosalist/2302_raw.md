Hi! 
Excuse me that I am writing again to criticize the GID dictionary. As =
you may check, the GID lacks a series of basic words, which are among the 5=
000 most frequently-used words in English (Davies & Gardner, 2010: A freque=
ncy dictionary of American English):

absence, acceptable, activity, additi=
on, adolescent, aircraft, announcement, beauty, commander, creation, crista=
l, discourage, eastern, employment, establishment, expertise, formation, ki=
ller, lover, married, multiple, oversee, physician, proposition, reflection=
, rhetoric, seventh, shuttle, singer, sixth, stranger, thinking.

This is n=
ot an exhaustive list, and still it would be longer if I had included many =
words which are not among the 5000 most frequently-used, yet they are quite=
 common:

amusing, annoying, believer, clan, desirable, dictator, disciple,=
 discouragement, eighteen, emptiness, fashionable, footstep, fourteen, furt=
hest, grandparent, grieve, guardian, hateful, helper, helpless, imitation, =
imperfect, interpreter, ninth, ordinal, reddish, riches, simplicity, simpli=
fy, stimulus, tenth, thirsty, thirteen, etc.

Greetings,
Xavi.
