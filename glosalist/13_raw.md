Agreed. I'm subscribed to 50 or so lists on Yahoo, have most
set to no-mail (website only), the remainder set to mail digests
(no HTML, right!), and, naturally, only have enough time to
actually participate in a very few.

If you avoid the website, reading as email (especially digested),
the adverts aren't very obtrusive at all. It works very well.
Maintains the archives too, and in an easily searchable fashion!

Salata,
Bill
