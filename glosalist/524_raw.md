Hello Bill and welcome
We qre not enormously active at the moment, various mis-haps have culled or 
put aside a number of us - things will appear on this list before long - I'm 
exploring one or two IALs and how they can be perhaps even further simplified - 
I like glosa much more than others- more anon
you could contact Wendy Ashby (one of the founders)
There are pages on the web but I can't remember them, they will however 
appear before long
