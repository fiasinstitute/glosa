hello
I am french and I am looking for french speakers who could teach me 
glosa by email or mail.

I would like to know to if the famous Shakespeare's "to be or not to 
be" was translated in Glosa and if yes, where I can find it.

I hope answers. Thank you.

Sebastien from France.

P.S: I am sorry for my bad English
