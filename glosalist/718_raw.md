         Thank you for this insight from Russia.  All of those who 
extol Esperanto have given other reasons for its taking off, but not this one.

         Were I rich, I could relax and get on with planning a 
campaign to get Glosa off the slip rails.  However, I think that 
there are very few altruistic philanthropists left.

         Needless to say, as a language, it does need considerably 
more use, and more users before it comes onto the radar of people 
with money to offer.

         Hmm, translating the works of an uplifting writer into 
Glosa... it could work.

It's a good idea,

Robin Gaskell
    P.S.  I'd say we'd get best results with a shorter work, sharing 
the translation between our number, and working co-operatively.
          How many rich, uplifting writers are there?
