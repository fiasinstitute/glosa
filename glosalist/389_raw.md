dear igor
i suggested "du" etc some years ago, glad to have someone agree. i seem to 
need to know where the verb phrase begins to prevent my being confused 
(ridiculously easy nowadays) about which is subject, verb etc. I like glosa's use of 
introducing words to phrases - very helpful - i am very pleased also with the 
amount of glosa coming through although i can't possibly keep up with it
sorry for the eng and not g
syd
