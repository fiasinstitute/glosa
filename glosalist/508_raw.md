I know very little about Glosa, but have been thinking about a common
language for awhile and happened to stumble across it this week.

I put together a blog entry today putting forth an idea, and was
wondering if anyone outside the programming world could provide
feedback on it.  I'm not even sure if it's a new idea or not.

Basically :

Now and even more so in the future people will be reading information
stored on computers.  I'm sure we can design new letters which are
easy to read in print and in electronic form, while still being simple
for computers to recognize.  Graffiti is used by the Palm Pilot as an
alternative to the Modern Latin Alphabet.  If we use Graffiti-type
letters instead of the Latin or Roman letters it would be easier for
computers to recognize the text.  Combined with Glosa, we'd not only
have a language which allows cultures to communicate, but for
computers to recognize easily as well.

Entire blog entry:

Sorry if this board usually posts in Glosa opposed to English, I don't
have any experience with it yet.  My Glosa in the blog entry may also
need to be corrected.
