just added this to wiki - a bit controversial perhaps!
 
a heretic glosa grammar
pronouncing
the rules as far as i see it  are:-
learn english south eastern middle class sounds plus some scottish and 
 
some italian .\ learn also the exceptions c g j q x z and sc .\ some of 
 
these are not phonetic - one sound, one sign ......\
this is very  confusing to anyone not english and without a roman 
 
alphabet, without access to recordings of the sounds,  being a trifle 
 
confused generally and so on .\
i suggest that all letter signs in glosa  have the same sounds as those 
 
in the international phonetics alphabet, they should be  made clearly, 
 
accurately and completely .\ further we do without capitals in work to 
 
be read by beginners etc .\
