To answer your question about the server, it doe=
sn't provide a
database program.  The program is provided over the net in t=
he form of
a Java script, and gets executed on your computer in order to ac=
cess a
database on the server.  The whole thing ( database and Java script =
)
is provided in the file included in the Files section of this website.
 W=
hen that gets executed on your computer, there is no Web access
involved, a=
nd you might as well be off-line.
