Glosa dictionary
I was looking at you're post, thinking that I could transl=
ate it with
Gish for you to see, when I realized that I missed the 've apos=
trophe
ending.  Will work on that today, and then maybe I'll add it to the
=
files section.  My next project will be a Glosa to English translator,
whic=
h technically is easier, but involves defining single Glosa
equivalents to =
concepts that are referred by several words in English.
