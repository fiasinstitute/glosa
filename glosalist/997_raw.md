ecause it seems impossible to make some change in Glosa (nobody
have the au=
thority to decide), by desesperance I am working for a new
Glosa, with the =
ideas of my ergo-glosa web-pages. I name it Pan-glosa,
(but why not Glosa++=
 !) : it should be a poor-grammar language. 
The vocabulary is the same tha=
n Glosa's (a very good base), with only
few changes. 
The hard think is how=
 to determinate what word is realy not a
word-concept! I hope a very small =
number of these no-word-concept.
It's not sure than I am able, alone,  to d=
ecide about a so complex 
problem.
Pero, vamos a ver en los tiempos que vie=
nen.

Daniel
