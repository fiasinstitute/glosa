I believe =
that for many/most current English/Glosa speakers, that is
true. I remain o=
ptimistic that it does not have to be true. I think
with some adjustments t=
o the language, and adoption of common
conventions, Glosa could be quite ne=
utral.

Great.

On a =
separate but related note, I am still trying to find the right
balance betw=
een tight rules about word meanings (Lojban) and very
loose rules (Toki Pon=
a).


Thanks for clarifying. Makes a lot of sense now, and I agree with muc=
h
of what you said.
