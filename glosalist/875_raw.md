Just uploaded a new version, with the following improvements:

1) More apos=
trophe endings recognized ( you'd, don't ).
2) Proper spacing between lette=
r and non-letter characters.
3) Now recognizes the "in" and "un" prefixes. =
For example,
"inconsiderate" returns ?ne-?examina, with the question marks =
because
neither it nor 'considerate' appears in the dictionary.  "Unbreakab=
le"
=3D=3D ?ne-?frakti.
4) More efficient calculation of the percentage pro=
cessed.
