dear marcel 
i am looking at esperanto at the moment and, as several contributers to 
glosalist would like to use it, i think it could useful to glosa if glosalist asked 
for contributions in glosa and about glosa in english as before but in 
addition about g in easp
so far i much prefer g even though i do a fair amount of grumbling. however, 
i do not see any rivallry or competition between the two languages g seems to 
be parallel with western europe and esp with eastern.
if the two languages are good ials, it should be easy to use both
comparisons to follow
syd
