I have read with interest thge " sound of u '''" letters and agree with much 
that has been said . I have been thinking on similar lines for some time and 
have started translating a story that my first wife wrote some years ago just 
before she died . as I translate I shall analyse and try to make the process as 
simple and logical as possible . some readers will disagree but it might help 
to get glosa more clearly thought out
