Assuming that I haven't misunderstood, I'll have to disagree.
A Yahoo! group can be used exactly like our current listserver.
If you join by sending an email to the group, you can use it
just like a regular mailing list and you never have to go to
the website. If instead you choose to use the website (in which
case you'll have to register (it's free)), you can still use
it just like a regular mailing list, or turn off the mail and
just read and post online, or both, search the archives, etc.
There is also a files area for each group where we could store
dictionaries and samples and such.

For example, concerning those many lists I've subscribed: the
ones in which I'm most active and/or interested I receive as
emails or email digests, while for the others I've disabled
the email and just pop into the website occasionally to see
what's new.

Over the past few years Yahoo! has absorbed several other list
servers, some of which had themselves absorbed others, such as
OneList, eGroups, etc. That's how I ended up on so many Yahoo!
lists! Whether that's good or bad I don't really have an opinion,
but in truth it works as well as did the other smaller ones.

One advantage to Yahoo! is that it is large and well-known. People
would be more likely to find glosalist while searching for lists by
keywords such as glosa or interglossa or international language.
If we mentioned Greek and Latin and Esperanto we'd be even more
likely to attract some new members.

It is possible to have multiple moderators on a Yahoo! list. Some
lists choose several moderators located around the world to increase
the probability that one will be awake and ready to moderate at any
given time.

Salata,
Bill
