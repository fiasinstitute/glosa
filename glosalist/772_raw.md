try again - sent a blank mail !
i have made a page or whatever on wiki called sydglosa but am confused - it  
contains part of a short story written in engklish by my first wife and  
translated by me i shall add more
is it there! if that is working i shall add ,more bits like it and would  
like to open another separate page etc to hold my burblings and heresies on  
glosa structure grammar etc
someone let me know if my first efforts are availabe or not 
this wiki thing should help glosa a lot - by the way, what is a blogg and  
would that help
should anyone wish to use my stuff for pgn for example, feel free
 
syd
