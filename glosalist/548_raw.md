Except of flame, the only significicant thought in that esperanto-thread is that Lluï¿½s offers to create an alternative Glosa-branch 'cause of the neat idea of the language and its strange realization. The words "strange realization" almost concern the English-like grammar of Glosa.

Suprisingly, during last several days at 
http://www.e-novosti.info/forumo (it's the russian forum about 
Esperanto) they debate on Glosa's grammar defects.
This is my question:
    *is Glosa an open project and is it possible to modify it's grammar 
if there will be concrete suggestions?*

PS The Glosa community isn't sufficiently open. At least publish any 
information about it at http://www.UniLang.org <http://www.unilang.org>!

  Then the mind stuff, reflecting both the knower and the knowable, becomes
