Hello friends ... especially Lluis,
    I am responding [reacting?] to various comments about the unsuitability 
of Glosa in its present form and to the possibility of modifying it to 
improve it.

    Sorry about the very, very bad politics of suggesting that Glosa cannot 
be improved.  Were we to live in a perfect world, everything could be 
improved, CONSIDERABLY - even English - however from my observation of the 
way things work, I note that this world carries a rather imperfect sample 
of sentient beings, and so, perfection is out - for the moment.

    Now having stuck around for 69 years, I am probably tiring of the 
language battleground.

    However, it can be said that I suffer from the "Peter Pan Perplex" 
[Ref. J.M. Barry _Peter Pan and Wendy_] ... I just never grew up.  This 
affliction left me with the mistaken belief that every one was doing their 
best, and that things would continue to get better and better.   Well, as 
all sane people know, the opposite seems to be true.

    On the Glosa front, I was convinced by Ron Clark that, of the surviving 
national languages, English was probably the one that had undergone most 
evolutionary changes.  English had been hit hard by invasion after invasion 
of people wanting the islands of Britain, and, accordingly, the language 
had altered gradually following successive waves of linguistic imprint - 
BUT the continuing trend of the modifications was towards a continual 
simplification.  Complications of previous language systems were 
progressively lost as newer systems were implanted: confusing grammatical 
morphologies were watered down and successful communication modes were kept.
    Bit by bit the speech and writing of Britain evolved through a 
relatively large number of environmental changes.  The end result, the 
English language we have now,
is an open system full of evolutionary adaptations.
    Or so that was how I waded into the the mellee that was Conlang discussion.

    Trying hard to be positive - still suffering from my 'perplex' - I 
would say that one day in the far distant future, what remains of the Human 
Race will adopt an Earth Language for the purpose of simplifying the 
process of communicating internationally.
     Rather than have the speakers of Russian, or Chinese, say that English 
is virtually impossible to learn to speak like a native, I would think it 
more productive for those, who wish to communicate globally, to start from 
a point of view of pooling ideas, and determining the qualities of a 
language that all primary school-children could learn.  While oldies, like 
me, will die out soon enough, taking our language preconceptions with us, 
Civilisation will probably go on; and, what is new to-day will be old 
to-morrow.  Of course, a Lingua Munda will be created by adults and taught 
by adults, so, obviously, it will have to be understandable to adults - at 
least to the creative ones amongst them.

    I am worn out by the language debate, and cannot justify spending more 
time in it.  Needless to say, I will agree that Glosa can be considerably 
improved, however, the qualities of good language seem to be extremely 
subjective in their interpretation from one person to another, so we will 
never find a set of criteria that can be agreed to by all.  While a few of 
the more creative writers will always be able to express themselves 
beautifully in whatever language they have inherited, many adults have been 
linguistically crippled by the language that they have had foist upon them 
by their culture.  Attitudes towards the articulation of concepts, to the 
possible qualities of words; and even neuro-muscular patterns acquired to 
speak a particular language all delimit the languages that can be used by 
adult populations.  But, the most significant limiting factor on the 
development of single Auxilliary Language for all Mankind is the matter of 
ego: both individual ego and national ego.

    While Glosa can be neatly labelled as the Planned Language with 
Classical vocabulary and Syntax-based Grammar, it lacks a significant 
user-base and any noticeable corpus of written works - it is destined to 
end up as a museum exhibit.

    And while the followers of Glosa primarily spent their energies on 
refining the vocabulary instead of in developing a feel for the concept 
articulation that the language allowed, no body of writing was 
developed.  I have the feeling that either our knowledge of language has 
not progressed far enough for our experts to expand on the fact that 
syntactical relationships have been shown to be a large part of language 
function in the brain; or that the leading edge of language activists in 
our civilisation are not ready to experiment with Syntax-based 
Grammar.  There is, of course, the opposing hypothesis that an overlaying 
level of culturally created inflections is a psychological need for the 
brain: we appear to thrive on the complexity that can be put into the 
morphology, and sound, of words.

   Oh yes, for those who are still with me, below this (NOT as an 
Attachment) is an example of a syntax analysis system based on ASCII symbols:




             The gASCII Analysed Syntax (GAS) system  (Alpha Test ver.)

             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brief Outline.

       * This is a means of codifying the syntactic function of the
         elements of a sentence.  Using this analysis, we can see the
         functional structure of a sentence, without needing to refer
         to the actual words.

       * The analysis can be done either manually or by machine; if
         done automatically, the code can be used as part of a program
         that parses the language.  It has the advantage that it can be
         scrutinised, if necessary, during the parsing process.



Natural Language Processing

       - This system was invented with both English and the Planned
         Language, Glosa, in mind.  Although linguists have attempted
         to codify the syntax of English, the average educated person
         has learnt his or her use of syntax through practice, and
         there is no easily-read reference book in which the syntax
         rules can be found.

       - Glosa is in a worse position: prior to this, no-one has
         codified its intuitively-used syntax.  This system is
         presented as a means of stabalising that syntax.

  Rationale.

      i. ASCII code can be read by OCR software.
     ii. ASCII code transmits through the Internet.
    iii. The various syntactic elements can be covered, in general,
          by the non-alphanumeric ASCII symbols.
     iv. Some semantic categories can also be shown.
      v. Small syntactic distances are shown using single spaces.
     vi. Syntactic spaces between phrases are shown as double spaces.
    vii. Larger syntactic distances, such as those between the major
           parts of a sentence (S-V-O) and between clauses, are
           indicated with triple spaces.
   viii. Clauses are marked with brackets - differently for adjectival,
           adverbial and noun clauses.
     ix. Non-literal language is marked: for ease of recognition
           and as an aid to machine translation.
      x. Patterns of syntax can be found by analysis, and used to
           prompt improvements in clarity.
     xi. Preferred patterns of syntax can be readily recognised and
           taught.
    xii. As part of a meaning representation system, the code (bearing
           the linguistic function) would be matched with the word or
           symbol (carrying the semantic content).
   xiii. Languages that have no morphological grammar will use this
           code to hold the information usually found in Part-of-Speech
           markers and grammatical inflections .. for purposes of
           the machine handling of information and translation.
    xiv. Generation of this code will be a function of Artificial
           Intelligence; the code generated can be perused and
           understood by the human operator of a mechanised translation
           system - thus allowing the process to be monitored.
     xv. The code permits the use of unchanging concept-words, ordered
            according to a syntax-based grammar ... in metalanguages,
            Intermediate Languages and concept-based auxiliary
            languages.

  Cheers,

    P.S. Does the Russian language permit analysis using this 
system?   Which languages cannot have their syntax analysed using a system 
like this?         R.
