Hogben in Interglossa used an initial capital letter
to indicate the main word in a noun phrase, so if we
follow his lead we may write:

u tako e bruno Vulpe salta supra u anti-ergo kani

We can see that 'salta' is the verb without any additional 'du' or 'nu'
but in such a simple sentence the meaning is surely obvious.

I think the best way to write any language is to keep things as simple 
as possible.

Saluta,
