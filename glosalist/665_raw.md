Ave panto-pe!  I am new to Glosa and find I am attracted to it because of i=
ts simplicity and 
charm.  However, delving into the vocabularies, there se=
em to be non-sensical redundancies.  
For example:

good, well:    boni [L]=
 vs. bene [L] vs. eu [G]
negation:      no(n) vs. ne vs. nuli
sweet:       =
    sukro [L] vs. dulce [L] vs. gluko [G] vs. suavi [L](?!)

Is there a dis=
cussion that someone could point me to regarding these, or similar?  As you=
 can 
imagine, finding good search terms on a micro-vocabulary is rather di=
fficult.  I would also 
imagine these have been debated somewhere.

Also, I=
 noticed the use of "suicide" for "suicide."  Wouldn't this be "pig killer"=
? and the proper 
compound in Glosa be "se-cide"?  "Sui" in Latin means "se=
lf" and in Glosa,  "se" is the form 
chosen.
