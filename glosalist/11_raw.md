Oops, that was not correct(?).  I just received my mail back from Kbx7.
( http://www.kbx7.de , "glosa-forum", glosa-forum@... ).  But I
did not get double mails of Nick and Walter from Kbx7, -- strange.
Unfortunately Kbx7 attaches not only advert-footers but also
advert-headers to the mails.

Please let us discuss what to do.  Gratia pre e saluta - Marcel.
