Hello,

I'm Chris Marshall, a composer from New Zealand. Looking at the various
Glosa resources I've discovered on the internet, I'm finding the language
has many very strong features and I would like to further my study of it. I
was wondering, is the Glosa 6000 dictionary available on disc? Would someone
be kind enough to send it to me as an email attachment?

Any assistance would be most appreciated.

Sincerely,
