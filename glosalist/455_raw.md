After the spamming of "Marisa" 

 > hey hey, just thought id tell you guys about this free debt
 > consolidation site ... 

I now have changed the settings: 

 - Every old member can post freely. 
 - All new members are moderated. 

But there are good news, too:  We have a "new" member, Daniel 
Alegrett (nickname "hispanido", ex Venezuela).  Daniel has been active
on Glosalist already in 1999, before I joined.  He is the author of
the first Spanish Glosa website,
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/9801/lenguas/ .   

Ave Daniel, bene-veni retro e saluta! - Welcome back.  

Marcel, listowner
