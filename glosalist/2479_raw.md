Dear friend
This is defect  in great glosa ! sooner you'll need more words =
, so you'll need the big bad wolf gid! which gives you for one meaning 3 wo=
rds! e.g nima , nomina; lexa, verba ; one greek(preferred?!!), the other la=
tin!
alas! Wendy and Ron Clark(whom I adore, as creators)
made errors(    I=
 created glisa, a better glosa):
1-choose greek  OR latin words
2- use la a=
nd un (the , a english); using u, un as an article to only to indicate the =
noun following is illogical)
3- using possessive pron. same as subject pron=
oun and suffix for gender! better el=3Dshe, -fe as feminine
4-using possess=
ives : ela bibli=3Dher ..
5-using ordinals : bi=3D two, bia=3Dsecond, usabl=
e before noun

6- removal of "-": bibli-vende-fe :bookseller girl
7- not us=
ing plu AWAY fom noun: plu cina kali boni gina
; better cina kali  boni pi =
gina !

You, dearest, can find other defects: Like natural languages, none =
  dare change it  :-( Glosa is defective, simple And complicated glosa!!!
