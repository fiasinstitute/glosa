A while ago I created a flashcard database for the FullRecall software and
posted it to my website. My website has since expired so I have re-posted it
here:

http://code.google.com/p/glosalib/downloads/list

The FullRecall software can be found at http://fullrecall.com/

It is designed to test words that are most likely to have been forgot while
not testing words that you know pretty well. In this way a large number of
words can be memorized most efficiently. These 1750 words were taken from
the glosa to english text file at the glosa.org site.

My site is listed at glosa.org but is deprecated and needs to be updated to
the above site.

Regards,
Bill Branch
