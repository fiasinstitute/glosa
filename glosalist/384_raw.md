Saluta Robin,


  If the rules of a language give the controlling of the me=
aning fully in the hands of the users, without restrictions, that will lead=
 to rising of meaningless phrases. 
  Only the most experienced users will =
use that language correctly. But this language want to be a common language=
 not only for experts, but for those who will use the language only seldom.=
 So, it's users wont be good novelists.

  It is not admitted that a collec=
tion of language-rules leave all the meaning to the context.
I think, the G=
losa, while it wanted to become an easy language and tended to be simple, h=
ave lost a lot of the necessary features that you can find in the English, =
and this way it became a more difficult to use language.

The same thing ha=
ppens with Esp. In It's case, the problem rised because of it's exaggerated=
 indecency on the word order and the formative-endings.
It seems that the h=
istory repeat it's own.


Saluta,

Laslo
