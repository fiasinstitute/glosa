I've been studying Glosa [url=3Dhttp://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm#S4]here[/u=
rl] for a day or two now and i like what i see, but i have a few questions,=
 mostly about the vocabulary.

it seems to be sorta incomplete and ambiguou=
s to me. for one i cant find any words for clothing except for 'underwear' =
(???) which apparently is also the word 'shirt' (??????). though i imagine =
some of them wouldn't be too hard to conjure up (manu-ve, pedi-ve, nekto-ve=
, somni-ve etc...) it doesn't appear to have a word for 'pants'. 

another =
is the ambiguity i'm coming across. like for example, dictionary here lists=
 three different words for 'sleep': sopo, dormi, and somni. even though the=
 dictionary recommends only using somni, for some odd reason the word for '=
to go to sleep' is sit sopo. another odd when is tura and trakto, both of w=
hich mean 'to pull' and both are recommended equally (the dictionary has pl=
us signs next to all the words to show which ones are preferred).

if you c=
are, here's the dictionary I'm using, the main glosa page claims it's the m=
ost comprehensive dictionary on the web for glosa:

[url]http://www.glosa.o=
rg/gid/engl.htm[/url]

is it really that reliable? the thing claims the wor=
d for 'left-handed' is just 'laevo'.
