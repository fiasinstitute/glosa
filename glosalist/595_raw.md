Hi sid,
    This sentence is one I'd probably like to see run with ^trainer wheels^.

>    u ergo-pe du ergo boni e u an ergo du ergo in u longi tem.

      Assuming that you started with an English-language sentence in 
your head,  I'd probably like to see what it was before I could 
comment on this Glosa version.

      I'd agree that ~nu-tem~ would mean 'now', but feel it is 
probably unnecessary if ~nu~ does the job, and sentences were clearly written.
