For example, I see having the letter "x" as a flaw since its sound can
alre=
ady be sounded out through "k + s".


Another flaw is "q". It' the same exa=
ct sound as "k" except that
sometimes it is "k + u".

Also, in IPA, sh =3D =
/ʃ/ and ch =3D /tʃ/ so why is sh =3D sc and ch =3D c in
Glosa.

W=
ouldn't it make more sence to have

c =3D /ʃ/

and 

tc =3D /tʃ/
=


I also don't understand the use of "-". Sometimes the words are just
put =
next to each other but in some cases "-" is there.


I like Glosa for it ha=
s been an inspiration to me but honestly
speaking, what are some flaws you =
see in Glosa?
