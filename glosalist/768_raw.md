Thanks for your effort, Bill!  The wiki is really fun.  I recomm=
end
a visit at http://glosalist.pbwiki.com to all of you.  May it grow and
=
help Glosa.  

I think, it is especially good for people, who want to publi=
sh Glosa
stuff but do not want to start an own homepage for it.  A good pla=
ce
for their exercises and translations (short stories, poems, comics,
arti=
cles).  I know, that people (for example Syd) have precious
treasures hidde=
n in their cupboards.  Please take them out and put
them on. 

Saluta - Mar=
