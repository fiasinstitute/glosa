Hello Troy and welcome to Glosa - I (for one) am in agreement with your thoughts concerning duplication of words and - to add to that - there are many cases where one word is used to represent more than one meaning.   Kevin Smith began to rectify some of these "contradictions" and I think that it would not be such a difficult task to review the dictionary (the inet being the best) - and thus improve the language considerably.   I think that the language has great potential but these anomalies need to be dealt with - who's to do it?
   Regards,   David.

  eh, sorry for all the typos. i've been doing that lately for some odd reason. when i said 'sit sopo' i meant 'sti sopo' and when i said 'another odd when is tura and trakto...' it should be 'another odd one is tura and trakto...'
