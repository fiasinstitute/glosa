Kim--

Wendy Ashby is the author of 18 STEPS and the owner of the Glosa lan=
guage.  Her work has been slow lately because of illness.  She has the sole=
 rights to make any changes to Glosa.  I don't think she has e-mail at the =
present time, but she is very good about answering questions if you send he=
r "snail mail."  Her address can be found at www.glosa.org.

I have tried t=
o answer some of these questions in my blog: glos-avanti.blogspot.com and c=
lick on "Sti Logi."

Saluta,
