I've read your messages for mounths. I've also read messages from
othere mailing list whose topic was Esperanto,Glosa, IDO, Interlingua
etc...
In my opinion (correcet me if I'm wrong)every group thiks to be the best
and, at the same time, expect that their language will replace all the
national languages.
What about creating a new language which sinthesize at least 3 or 4
artificial languages?
Every languages has its own vocabulary and, for example, if you write
in Interlingua you are not alllowed to use words of Esperanto, Ido and
so on. Is that so wrong and impossible?
Why can't we create a language whee everybody is free to choose the
words  she/he wants to use among the artificial languages which
already exist?
Why can't we create a language where spekers of other languages are
wellcome even if they continue to use their words?
Obviouslywe should make a compatibility plan of the grammar of this
new language.
Whois interested in this project, pleas contact me at this email
