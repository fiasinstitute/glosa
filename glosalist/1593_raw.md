it's not unusual for rare constructions like these to end up ambiguous, 'ti=
gers that fight' isnt exactly a common thing to hear in english, typically =
that specific contruction means that the act of doing something is dangerou=
s. it actually rarely leads to an ambiguity:
=A0
eating too much chocolate =
is bad for your health
=A0
there's only one way to interpret that. most of =
english's ambiguities are actually the result of the fact that it relies he=
avily on word order to differentiate betwen types of words, pretty much the=
 same way that glosa does. glosa actually has a far more common problem sin=
ce the phrase :an dice can mean 'he talks' or 'his speech' or 'male speech'=
. english would have a similar problem if it didnt conjugate words for the =
third person singular, otherwise 'a car park' and 'a car parks' would be id=
entical and indistinguishable.
