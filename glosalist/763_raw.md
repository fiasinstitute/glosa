We could have people working on different approaches to glosa methods and  
have them used. We could then let natural selection chose and alter  them. 
I suspect that when anyone hears a sentence or group of them,  they are 
sorted in the brain in structures like a general/universal grammar from  their own 
tongues and in my own method they are sorted from there into a Glosa  
structure. Different people will think in different ways . Some people are new  to 
glosa and need its structure made very clear and simple , others will be able  to 
shorten things. The verb 'es' is an example I have suggested 'du es' is  used 
for the present tense but as 'es' is very unlikely to be anything but a  
verb, 'es' alone could be quite clear. However, this adds one more rule or  
exception to be learned and the more variants we allow, the slower and more  
difficult the learning becomes and the less likely newcomers are likely to  
persevere.
