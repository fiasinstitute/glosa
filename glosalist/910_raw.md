I would like the book to be more readily available. It is a
good book, which I like very much. Any learning material
would be very good to see. I would like to see more
interest and activity than has been evident lately.  I know
my ability in Glosa is very limited but I do very much want
to get the language out there.

I have edited some files to make Glosa vocabulary available
on a Palm program called Supermemo.  It helps with
memorization.

The lack of the deka or ten is inconsistent with the rest
of the numbers and with most other languages.  Do you say
two two or twenty two? I deal with numbers a great deal and
it helps with clarity, I think, at least.

Saluta,
Tom
