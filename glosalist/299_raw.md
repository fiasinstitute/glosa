karo robin
I'm thinking of collecting much of the G in my email files and putting it on 
a CD. I'm hopelessly behind in my reading of it all. The CD could become 
available somehow. I ought to point out that I am 77 and have had one or two 
cardiac hicoughs in the last couple of months so I could make sure that the CD finds 
its way to Wendy or someone - I also have a number of mixedup PGNs to send to 
a more reliable home.........
very pleased with the new glosalist.......
