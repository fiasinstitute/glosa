Thank you very much for your response to my messages. I am grateful, 
even =
honored. You are obviously expert and you have great insight 
into the lang=
uage. I did not mean to offend you; if you did, I am 
sorry; that's was not=
 my intent. 
 
I am of origin of (ashamed to say) a colored race (not Himal=
ayan), 
who are often publicized as evil. I have had a lot of bad 
experien=
ces; still occasionally do. Forgive me that's all I would 
like to say abou=
t me at this time. 
 
They say that the best grammar is no grammar. If you =
follow this 
principle you can never have errors. If there are errors it's =
the 
person's perspective; inconsistent or not. I am not saying that's 
wha=
t Glosa is. I believe that the simplicity is one of the, if not 
the, goal =
of Glosa; and I think you have done an excellent job. 
 
PS: I'm sorry but =
I still feel that you might want to collect all 
the negative comments and =
put them in an appendix, unless you want 
to turn away newcomers.
