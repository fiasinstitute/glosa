i was once trying to teach english a lad from east bengladesh, pointed to  an 
object, asked its name and got "bokosa". asked for it to be written, i got  
"box". i believe that the japanese do something similar like  "supuringutajimu" 
 CVCVCVCVCVCVCV. i have suggested that Galosa does the  same as it is easy 
for westerners to say CVCVCV.... but not CCCVCCVVC for  easteners. so;  we could 
have gylosa CVCVCV. (in IPA) "y" would be very  quiet and need not be 
written; put it between any adjacent consonants. with  adjacent vowels we could 
decide on awa, awe, aji, awo, awu,eja, eji, eja, eio,  eju, ija, ije, iji, ijo, 
iju, owa, owe, owi, owo, owu, uwa, uwe, uwi , uwo, uwu  "plu w unda" again not 
needed to be written. use ipa + j/w and we have an  international language in 
sound
