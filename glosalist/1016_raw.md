Hi John

Yes, the vowels are pure vowels as in Spanish

The "AW" pronunciat=
ion is for the benefit of people 
from the south of England where all our s=
imple vowels 
have come to be pronounced as dipthongs or vowel glides.
So t=
he closest we get to a pure vowel sound for O is 
this one as in law, cause=
 or thought.
