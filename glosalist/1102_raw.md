Sona is a ConstructedLanguage created by KennethSearight (1883-1957).
Sona =
is mainly an a priori language. Searight, a polyglot and amateur
linguist, =
drew grammatical principles from a number of sources:
Chinese, Japanese, Ar=
abic, Pushtu (an Afghan language), Persian,
English, French, Russian, Itali=
an, and Indo-European roots.

Sona is an agglutinative language. It has a l=
exicon of 375 radicals or
ideograms (Searight's term). Although Sona is wri=
tten with Latin
characters, Searight compared each radical to Chinese (or J=
apanese)
ideograms: indivisible elements of meaning.

Each radical is mono-=
 or di-syllabic, in the form CV (ex: to), VCV
(ato), or CVn (ton). Only a, =
i, and u are used before a consonant to
make a radical, and no disyllabic r=
adical is made with the consonants
j, c, h, x, v, or f. An additional set o=
f radicals, of the form V (i),
Vn (on), and uV (uo), round out the lexicon.=
 Radicals are always
written in lowercase, and punctuation is mostly avoide=
d and
unspecified, except for terminal period ("."). 

What do you think of=
 it? Have you ever heard of it before?
