As me, a  team of linguists should leard in a high level mode at least thr=
ee planned languages from those most used, and then, they should analize th=
eirs ability wide-ranging.

I think, the regular system of joined words all=
ows you to use a small number of basic words. Otherwise, you need to use or=
der of magnitude many basic words.

It's easier to read non-joined words th=
an joined, but you have to know much more of them (of that non-joined).
Bey=
ond that, the languages which use non-joined words, require many prefabrica=
ted expressions.

So, I prefere English for reading, but Esp for writing.
