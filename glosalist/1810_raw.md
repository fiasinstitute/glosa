Evidence that Glosa is an international auxiliary language unfinished is th=
e name of countries and languages​​. Suppose that in some of th=
em use that name without the corresponding script becomes a dirty word in t=
he same or another language, something that happens with some Glosa words i=
n the second or third language of the Earth:
 Puta =3D prostitute
 Pene =3D=
 penis
 Pedo =3D fart.
 Another unresolved issue is the name beings of natu=
re especially animals that come to have names with capital letters and not =
ending in a vowel.
