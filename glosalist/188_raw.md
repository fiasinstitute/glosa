the problem with "pa" is that it has 2 functions. It gives the time but it 
also tells you that the phrase is a verb one. "Yesterday i go to the shops and  
look at them but  come away with nothing. Tomorrow i go again and get some 
paper."  In English the past tense elision is ok because I know easily which is 
the verb phrase. In Glosa "go /look /come /get " can be any part of speech and 
I often find the sentence difficult to sort out because the position of the 
verb is difficult to find. this is why Ishoud like all glosa verb phrases to 
have past, future or present markers of some sort or a separate part of speech 
marker or group of markers. i.e. "pa-di mi du ki ad plu boteka e va vide mu sed 
vu veni ab ko nuli ra mi fu ki itera te habe papiri". "va/ vu/ fu/ te" do 
intro verb phrase
