stress is easy enough - the vowel before the last consonant - leUko. glosa  
says that it is based on alternation of vowel /consonant, a very good idea, but 
 then ignores it! if we apply that principle, there would be no double vowels 
but  if we do,  i suggest that we insert the consonant "j" very quietly 
between  pairs of vowels, "lejuko" " u(j) andro(j) es" glosa does this to some 
extent "un  andro", "ad andro" but not with "plu andro"! we could have "uj andro 
aj andro  pluj andro". if this were generally accepted the "j" would not need 
to be  written.
once when I was trying to help a south east asian boy with his english, I  
pointed to a picture and he said "bokaso". when I asked him to write it I got  
"box" he was following the glosa principle of alternating  C and V. I  believe 
there are many english words incorporated in japanese but using CVCVCVC  . 
glosa could do the same - we have 5 vowels a e i o u if we used "schwa" which  is 
mid way between the 5, we could get "k#san#to" where # stands for "schwa" -  
we would say it as quietly as possible "k#santo" and if the # would disappear 
so  if it is hard to say use #, the japaneses do it is done on bengla and in  
italian
would that help?
