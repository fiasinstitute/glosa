I fear there is not much of a difference. In the current state of  
Glosa, where only few new texts are written in it, ANY change (either  
introducing a new marker, or using an existing marker differently)  
must be reflected in the EXISTING texts - the glosa.org web page, the  
"18 Steps", etc, because this is where any potential new glosa-pe  
learns about Glosa. If Glosa is supposed to be perceived as more than  
a play thing, these need to be consistent. I don't think this will  
happen without some authority telling somebody to do it.
