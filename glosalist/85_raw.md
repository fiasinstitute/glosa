*  I agree this is a subjective assessment on Gary's part - based on
personal experience of having tried the various languages.  It's ^seat of
the pants flying^, but carries a wisdom that much of Linguistics lacks.

*  How do we evaluate the learning of a language?
   Is it: fluency over time;
          ease of vocabulary learning;
          ability to handle complex concepts;
          fun .. the enjoyment of learning;
          logically satisfying grammar, related to ease of acquisition;
             ... or is it a combination of all these?
   Until the boffins come up with something I call an "evaluative
instrument", a test schedule that rates the effectiveness of a language as
a communication medium, then we are left to our own intuition.
   Time comes into it: if a language is to be acquired by the race as a
whole, then that language ought to be able to bring confidence to learners
fairly quickly.  And this brings into question the quality of the
instructional materials: these need to be intuitive but also logical - to
satisfy the breadth of human psychology.

   But without a lot of help from the Glosa authors, I had to discover the
syntactic patterns for myself.
   Now we know what constitutes a Glosa phrase, and that Glosa's sentence
structure generally follows that of good English, examples can be given,
and the principle that relative word position gives meaning can be
demonstrated.
   I really think it all comes down, again, to the preparation of inspired
instructional materials.

*  While I have not come via the Esperanto route, I, some time ago, reached
the same conclusion that Gary arrived at.
   No amount of discussion changes anything!  The only way for people to
discover Glosa's beauty is for them to use it.  So, I feel that instruction
for the two brain hemispheres needs to be given in parallel.
   For many people, the rules of syntax will have to be spelled out, while
the more intuitive, right hemisphere people will pick up the rhythms of
Glosa's sentence structure - 'osmotically.'

*  The "black box" has been called ''universal grammar,'' but this only
gives it a name without an explanation.  However, if the language ability
of the brain is ^hard-wired^ into its anatomy - as seems to be the case -
then we can almost say that some languages flow more smoothely along the
neural pathways than do others.  The major clue is the way English has
proved successful, while other languages have remained with their native
populations.  
   What does English have, and what does it lack, that makes it a ready
currency of communication?  In its formation as a 'creole,' what were the
"archaic" features that were lost, and what are the flexible qualities that
were retained, to make it more readily acceptable and usable?
   Did Ron Clark while assessing Hogben's work, have one eye over his
shoulder at English, as well.

   Meanwhile, the Glosalist should be mainly in Glosa and about Glosa, so,
taking Gary's example, we ought to show that what we express in our native
language can be just as readily expressed in Glosa:-
