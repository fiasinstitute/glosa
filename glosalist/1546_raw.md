Many years ago I got Interglossa through a rare book dealer after reading Loom of Language. The copy is too frail for hard use. It sits sealed in plastic in a cool dry place. I can preserve it but am afraid to break the binding. I am glad the project had a last minute reprieve. What I need to know is - what changes were made besides making the spelling phonetic and expanding the vocabulary? Is the grammar identical? How useful is the original book as a guide to the new system? As an Esperantist, I know about splinter groups peeling off and starting there own systems. Also the Loglan - Lojban split. On a different subject - how close is the grammer of Glosa to Chinese? Greek based words and Chinese based grammar. Is that the crux of the system? Feel free to contact me in English or Esperanto - or Glossa for that matter. David Overley.
