Hi himalayancassi, thank you for visiting glosa.org,=
 for reading 18
Steps, for your comments and for joining us.  Welcome!  


=
What you see is a compromise: 

On the one hand, "18 Steps" is a work by tw=
o authors/artists.
Every artwork must be protected from later changes by ot=
hers.  I
respect Ron Clark, Wendy Ashby and their work a lot.  

On the oth=
er hand, this document is the main source for learning the
language.  So th=
e learner must get hints, where the original material
may be discussed. 

T=
his is done by means of italic annotations in brackets, leaving the
origina=
l text untouched. 


 > Not to mention it is insulting to the original auth=
ors for telling
 > the whole world what horrible work they've done.  

Ever=
y annotation is objective and informative, none insulting, I
hope.  If I (o=
r Nick, or others here) would have had the intention to
insult somebody, we=
 could have done it without so much effort. 

The Glosa books may be "horri=
ble", but the language Glosa is
excellent.  That is better than the other w=
ay round. 

Saluta - Marcel
