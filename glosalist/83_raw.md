Using English:
    I think this clause might have come over better as ...
      ~Roberti telefono an gina kusina Beti, ... ~
      [Robert telephones his wife's cousin, Betty, ...]

    I assume that that was the intended message.

    In the second NounPhrase, I'd say there are three semantic items:-
                 (using pseudo-Linguistic speak)
 
       Determinant/NP-marker / OR alternative    AN        = his

       Descriptive/Modifier                      GINA      = wife's
            
       Substantive                               KUSINA    = cousin 


    The matter of 'Beti' seems, as in English, to be a supplementary
phrase, repeating, or encapsulating, the meaning of the primary phrase.
So, as in English, a comma could have been used to separate the 'phrases.

    Thus, for style, I might have added a hyphen and a comma, but they are
not essential to the syntax:-
         ~ ... an gina-kusina, Beti, ... ~

    What I'd say is non-Glosa is the use of mutually exclusive elements at
the 
 ''Determinant/NP-marker / OR alternative'' end of the phrase.

      It is either "the wife's cousin"   =   ~u gina kusina~

              OR   "his wife's cousin"   =   ~an gina kusina~
       
     NOT BOTH  "the his wife's cousin"   \=  ~un an gina kusina~*        


>(2)     "Qe tu ski qo Skarbro es homo in Meno Mo Bi? 

      I have no complaint that Betty might speak like this using
English-language idiom, But I am worried that, in communicating with
someone outside the English-language area she might get ^wires crossed^ in
using such vernacular English structure.
      I feel that the word ~meteo~ would internationalise the context, and
prevent Betty's sentence from sounding like relexified English, EG

         ~Qe, tu ski u meteo de Skarbro durante Meno Mo Bi?~ 

 


>(3)       "  Si tu veni, qo modo mi amusa vi?"

       This is quite undersandable: the meaning is clear, and Betty's
quandry is very understandable.
       But  "you"  is either  ~tu~  or  ~vi~  depending on Number - not
familiarity.  So, Betty would correctly use ~tu~ when speaking to her cousin.

                Sing.  Plural
   Person  1      mi     na
           2      tu     vi
           3   an/fe/id  mu    

***  I will just have to wait to find out what made South Africa too hot
for Robert to stay.


###  While I am not a Linguist, with apologies, I find some of their
terminology useful.  For me, in previous Mail Lists, understanding what the
linguistic terms meant, was a painful learning process - intuiting what
they were going on about - because few of the terms were explained to the
neophytes.  I do not want to repeat that process here.

%%%  But I did get my own back: in the difficult process of finding a
descriptive term for Glosa's style of grammar, I got no help from the
Linguists; but I finally coined the term, "Syntax-based Grammar," and that
was accepted, as valid - though somewhat begrudgingly.

Saluta,
