Tom, I will repeat here wh=
at my program says about those sentences:
I like cooking:
Mi homo smell 
( =
This is what is called a bug in computer parlance, apparently
cooking is de=
fined as smell, actually 'cooking smell' is defined as
'nidor' in the Engli=
sh-Glosa dictionary, and my program was unable to
detect the difference. )
=
I love cooking:
Mi amo smell
I enjoy cooking:
Mi fo-amo smell
As for the em=
otion of love, 
emotion:
emotio
I'll be upgrading my program as soon as I l=
ook it over again to see if
there are any more corrections to take care of.=
  The date of the
upgrade is always indicated at the site:
