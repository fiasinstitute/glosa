Back of the /jacal/ a tremendous forest of bristling pear, twenty feet=

high at its worst, crowded almost to its door.

s-lo, a maxi alti de sixa metra, es proxi a porta.

It was along the bewild=
ering maze of this spinous thicket that the
speckled roan would bring the K=
id to see his girl.

-makula equs fero u Juve-an tende visita an filo-fe.

And once, clinging li=
ke a lizard to the ridge-pole, high up under the
peaked grass roof, he had =
heard Tonia, with her Madonna face and
Carmen beauty and humming-bird soul,=
 parley with the sheriff's posse,
denying knowledge of her man in her soft =
/melange/ of Spanish and
English.

uto filo-an per no-voci mixa ex Espa=F1a e England lingua.
