Saluta a plu lista-pe,

Thanks for your comment. As far as the expressions "dona auxi", "dice u petitio" or "dice u qestio" are concerned, I think they are not any additional study material to memorize. I use the words "dona" or "dice" only according to logic, not because it is decided so. You can use a word "akti" instead of "dona" without any special change of its meaning.

You also wrote:

It seems that you can see such a structure in Sasxsek language.

One more thing: I have spent some time comparing the International Auxiliary Languages which may be regarded as isolating and I see they are really very few. For example, Lingua Franca Nova, a quite popular IAL, has many isolating features but it maintains the letter "s" to form the plural, it also uses special suffixes to form the active and passive participles and it has some other useful affixes.
I also took a closer look at a very interesting language Sona and I see it is only partially isolating, with a very sophisticated agglutinative system. In such comparison Glosa seems to be completely isolating, so it is a quite unique IAL. The question is not which grammar structure is the best. Every IAL has its advantages. An interesting question here is why the IALs like Glosa are so few. 


Plu saluta,

Igor Wasilewski

P.S. In my previous message I wrote "agglunating". Sorry, it should be "agglutinating" of course.
