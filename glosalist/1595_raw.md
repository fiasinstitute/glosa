 english's ambiguities are actually the result of the fact that it relies h=
eavily on word order to differentiate betwen types of words, pretty much th=
e same way that glosa does. glosa actually has a far more common problem si=
nce the phrase :an dice can mean 'he talks' or 'his speech' or 'male speech=
'. english would have a similar problem if it didnt conjugate words for the=
 third person singular, otherwise 'a car park' and 'a car parks' would be i=
dentical and indistinguishable.
