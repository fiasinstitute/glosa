Mi plu Amika,
I guess that some examples of writ=
ten Glosa be 
included in the entry given above.

The word "syntax" gets on=
ly a single mention: 
this could seem odd, since a description of its 
gram=
mar (which I coined) is 'Syntax-based 
Grammar'.  Also, the rule that 'a wo=
rd is 
modified by its precedent' also could be added; 
this concept leads =
to the clinically linguistic 
statement that Glosa has "Head Final" phrase =
structure.

I do not know who submitted this very brief entry 
on Glosa to =
the Wikipedia, but, had Ron Clark had 
a say in it, I guess he would have m=
entioned that 
Glosa was first conceived as a language for 
science - in th=
at it uses the same Classical 
source vocabularies as those that were used =
as 
the basis of scientific nomenclature.

The reference to "Glossa" is qui=
te historical: I 
clearly remember saying to Ron and Wendy that 
even thoug=
h this name historically related the 
new language to its predecessor, Inte=
rglossa, it 
was inconsistent with the rule eliminating double 
letters fro=
m 'native' Glosa words.  The ~Glosa~ 
name took over shortly afterwards.

O=
ne addition that might be hard to put into words 
compares Glosa sentence s=
tructure with that of 
English - which, in its pure form, is the model 
for=
 sentence structure in Glosa - that, while one 
can 'map' English words ont=
o a Glosa sentence, 
and produce a reasonably acceptable sentence in 
Engli=
sh, the reverse process does not produce good Glosa.

Saluta,

Robin
