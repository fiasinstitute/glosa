I'm surprised to only find a snail mail address to the UK from which to 
pu=
rchase "18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa." Please, don't tell me that, in 
this=
 modern age, I have to send a paper check via the postal service 
across th=
e pond to acquire the material necessary to properly learn 
Glosa. 

I've b=
een searching the web for something better to learn, and even 
tinkering wi=
th my own conlang, but the only auxlang that won't get out 
of my head is G=
losa! 

What books do I need to buy to learn Glosa, and from where? 

Thank=
 you.
