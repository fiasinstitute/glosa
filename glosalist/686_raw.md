Karo Robin

Mi fu bali plu item mi grafo; a na grega.

My first Item is goi=
ng to be submitted to langmaker.com. I noticed
that Glosa does not have a b=
abel text sample there. Being that my
Glosa is currently horrible, and per =
your request, I'm first running
it by everyone on the list. I'm sure it has=
 several syntax errors in it. 

I'm still confused about sentence structure=
, since I don't think to
much about it in English. I am not very good at En=
glish parts of speech. 

I did try to re-order the words to fit the formats=
 laid out in the
several grammars referenced from the English front page at=
 glosa.org.

I plan on submitting it in about a week after making any corre=
ctions.

Well here it is:
