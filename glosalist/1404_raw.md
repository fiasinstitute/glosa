Dear Oleg,
Well said! Indeed, in my first hearing those hearing samples las=
t November I really found the same strange things as what you have found an=
d I thought there are some things we had to discuss for clarification and g=
iving some improvement on the endings such as "-an, -fe, -pe; -ma, -te, -ka=
, -mo, ect.".

Sometimes, just like what happens to many languages usually,=
 people don't follow the rules of the common or unpassionate standard stres=
s which means the stress wouldn't be on where it ought to as in dictionarie=
s but on the passionate syllable that people want to as their mood. On this=
 aspect, you, a western language speaker, definitely found it earlier. For =
example in English: continue=3D[conTInue] in standard or common; [CONtinue,=
contiNUE,or even CONTINUE] in passionate. I did found those in many origina=
l English films. For Glosa, as per its original will, it must be pronounced=
 like that in stress and tone.However, there really are some confusions cau=
sed by that. 
Exp: 
auxi-fe[aUksife]=3Dfemale helper, auxi fe [aUksiFe]=3Dh=
elp her. If you pronounce them two as per the said way--the Passionate Stre=
ss, probably auxi-fe[aUksi-fe] prnounced as [aUksiFe] and auxi fe[aUksiFe] =
as [aUksife]. (aUxi=3D[a-'uk-si], if as Auksi['a-uk-si], could be accepted,=
 but not extremely standard) Therefore, I ever suggested to replace some ol=
d endings by some new. Exp: 
-gi,gi-=3D(-fe,fe-):auxi-gi=3Dfemale helper, a=
uxi fe=3Dhelp her; gi-bovi=3Dfemale ox(cow), bovi-gi=3Dcow girl; Fe auxi an=
=3Dshe helps him. {"gi" derives from "GIna"=3Dwoman}

-ro,ro-=3D(-an,an-):a=
uxi-ro=3Dmale helper, auxi an=3Dhelp him; ro-bovi=3Dmale ox(bull), bovi-ro=
=3Dcow boy; An auxi fe=3Dhe helps her.{"ro" derives from "andRO"=3Dman} 

-=
pe remains the original usage: auxi-pe=3Dhelper
pu=3D(pe): auxi pu=3Dhelp p=
eople; pu dice=3Dpeople say {"pu" derives from "poPUla"=3Dpeople, populatio=
n}

Hereby, we can distinguish gi, ro, pe from fe, an, pu quite easily and =
clearly by hearing.

From those on:

-ri=3D(-ma) meaning matter and materia=
l. Because the "ma" meaning "more" has been defined. "ri" derives from "mat=
eRIa". Exp: bio-ri=3D(bio-ma) living thing, bibe-ri=3D(bibe-ma) drink(s)

-=
ti=3D(-te) meaning textile and cloth. Because the same "te" also shortened =
for "tende", defined. "ri" derives from "texTIli". Exp: pedi-ti=3D(pedi-te)=
 socks, tabla-ti=3D(tabla-te) table cloth

-ca=3D(-ka) meaning a room. Beca=
use the same "ka" also shortened for "kausa", defined. "ca" derives from "C=
Ambra(=3Dkamera)" which isn't in the GID but I, for this, strongly advise t=
o add it in. Exp: kuko-ca=3D(kuko-ka) kitchen, kli-ca=3D(kli-ka) Bedroom.  =
 * I ever thought about "-lu (derives from voLUmi)" which also means "room"=
 among all its meanings, but the "room" here means "space", I don't know wh=
ether -lu could be OK

*-mo: Currently remained. I'm in hard thinking about=
 another better mechanic replacing "-mo", because which means "one". 

I ho=
pe more Glosa friends will agree on my idea which is for Glosa's improvemen=
t and progress like its authors Mr. Ron Clark and Ms. Wendy Ashby did 30 ye=
ars ago. It is high time for us to improve Glosa. Do more for it! Give it a=
 new better life!

Saluta!
Li Zhenyu
