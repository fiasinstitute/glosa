I'm fine with how the Glosa alphabet and sounds are. However, I do 
like th=
e idea of using "x" for "sh" (as done by Ceqli and many other 
conlangs), a=
nd would welcome the "ks" sounds being spelled as "ks". 
Also, I would spel=
l "xanto" (yellow), "xeno" (strange), "xilo" (wood) 
as "zanto", "zeno", "z=
ilo", and the same for any word that uses "x" 
when "z" would be better. We=
ll, I guess I see the logic in using "ku" 
or "kw" instead of "q" for the "=
kyoo" or kw" sound. But there's no 
end to tinkering with the alphabet.  I =
would vote to just leave it 
alone as is.

Then again, since Glosa is not b=
eing promoted very well by the 
current owner(s), perhaps a Glosa reform mo=
vement similiar to 
Esperanto's Ido offshoot would be in order. I don't kno=
w.
