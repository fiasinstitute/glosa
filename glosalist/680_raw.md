I meant to do something about wikopedia but was interupted by health  
problems - hope you succeed - I am hoping to make a web page with my [somewhat  
heretic] ideas and how to think in glosa/bridge language universalish grammar  etc 
- i am finding getting a sensible title difficult - who would think that 
_www.hometown/my_ (http://www.hometown/my)  baby or photos etc would be  about 
glosa?
