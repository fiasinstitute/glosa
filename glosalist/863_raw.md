Tooday I uploaded a version with the following improvem=
ents:

1.  Much better recognition for all sorts of plurals.
2.  Recognitio=
n for the 'ive' ending, including 'ively'.

Will remember to add recognitio=
n for the 'ism' and 'ist' endings in
the next upgrade, which will concentra=
te more on upgrading the
dictionary from then on, God willing.
