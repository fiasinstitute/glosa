Karo Glosa-pe--

First of all, let me say all of you must be doing something right.  When
I Google "international auxiliary language," Glosa comes up 4th on the
list!

I have put some new files in the group archives.  They can be used to
print up business cards that contain a little "advertising" for Glosa. 
Two are Open Office documents, meant to be printed on both sides of a
sheet of 10 x 2 business cards.  The other two files are the individual
images, so you can arrange them for printing yourselves.  Sorry, I am
only able to do this for English speakers on American-sized paper.
