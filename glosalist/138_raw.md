Karo John,

I hope I'm helping you out here.  I think any problems you may have had
translating this will disappear after you get your "18 Steps" book.

I'm not sure if I understand this right, but I believe you said this:

There are three kinds of workers.
We either fit into one of these areas or between them.
Our work makes (us) rich, gets (us) ahead, or lets us survive.
Different minorities get rich, some people get ahead, and the majority is
satisfied from day to day.

If this sounds about right, pat yourself on the back; you have
_communicated_, and that is the main goal of any language.

You perhaps thought a little too hard.  Only one word showing number is
necessary before a noun:

Il es *tri plu* type... < (Il) es *tri* speci...

If you really need the _plu_, it should come before the _tri_:

(Il) es *plu* tri speci... = There are *the* three kinds...

_Minority_ would be better translated _minorita_ (from Marcel's GID)
or--always a good trick in Glosa--write out the meaning of the word, _u
mei (granda) mero de panto-pe_.

How to translate _critique_?  In this case my knowledge of Glosa isn't
pretty: _monstra plu ero_ = "show the errors."  Maybe someone else has
something better.

Thank you for the letter in Glosa!

Saluta,
 _  _
