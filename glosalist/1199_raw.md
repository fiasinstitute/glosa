  Subject: [glosalist] Introduction


    Hi!

  I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. I decided to learn Glosa, so I asked to be accepted as a member of the glosalist. Of course for the next weeks I'll only read the messages, at least untill I can write without making many mistakes.
  I want to but soem publication from The Glosa Education Organization, but I have some questions concerning the shipping costs... may you send me their e-mail direction?
  I am sure I'll have a lot to learn and share with you all.

  My best regards!
