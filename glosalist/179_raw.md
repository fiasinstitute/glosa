**  Truly, Glosa does have a sort of quiet authority about it.  This
strength seems to come from the powerful interaction between semantics and
syntax.
    It is my belief that the call upon Glosa users to employ the true word,
and not a metaphor, plus the pressure to use correct sentence structure as
an enhancement of meaning, give the language its great potential as a
communication medium.
