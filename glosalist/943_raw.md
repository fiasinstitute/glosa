the fonetik names look and sound very  well but it is not so easy to  find 
the places - perhaps a mixture of both where appropriate - skarbro 4504,  
kritimati 0217 - at a glance 45 is cooler than pari and the time not very  
different, 02 is much warmer and you would probably have jet-lag .......
