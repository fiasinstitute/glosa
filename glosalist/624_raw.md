Friends,
         This is definitely my bias as well.

         Considring that I can meet lots of people - using English - 
via the Net, it is only obvious that I will be able to meet many more 
the same way ... when a sensible Auxilliary Language is adopted for 
Net convenience.

         And, if people have trouble with learning another language, 
then they could reach more people by having a program that plugged 
them in to an auxilliary language.

         Thus the idea would be to find a Planned Language tthat was 
both easy for most people to use, and which was easily programable: 
such a language would, in my opinion be one whose grammar is more in 
line with syntax than an inflectional system.  Glosa feels closer to 
this ideal than does Esperanto.

Saluta,

Robin
