Hi, Stephan, and Marcel.

Glosa partially inherits the morphology plan of I=
nterglossa, which usually gives a final i to the nouns from the Latin 2d an=
d 3d declensions: agri, avi, bovi, cani, carni, clavi, feli, fili, flori, h=
orti, igni, infanti, insecti, etc. And it gives a final a to nouns from the=
 1t and 2d neuter: aqua, camera, carta, casea, cauda, nasa, etc.

Glosa see=
ms to develop its own morphology depending on derived words, which were usu=
ally adopted by English, such as nocturn(al) from Latin nocturnus. So Glosa=
 has noktu while Interglossa has nocti. Gary has given a good set of exampl=
es in the previous message.

I think this morphology plan makes the vocabul=
ary more difficult to memorize. So the dictionary of Glosa should provide t=
he etymologic key of every word (noktu < L. nocturnus, A. nocturnal), so we=
 can memorize the lexicon with confidence. Now we are usually forced to gue=
ss why the morphology of this or that word is as it is.

Greetings.
