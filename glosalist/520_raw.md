Thanks for your time! :)

I know what did you say about the English grammar, and the differences with the
glosa. I don't speak English as a mother language... and I don't think that its
structures "allow people to write both simply and logically".

In the bits of grammar of glosa, which I've read, isn't clear when one must use
the glosa "article", for introducing a 'noun phrase'.
And, how does one know, where the verb begins? So, how are the (verbal, noun)
phrases delimited?

By the other hand, do you say that when elliding those words (in "an ki domi"),
one can imagine the words, which aren't there. Well, I wouldn't image. I don't
know if "domi" is related to "ki" in any kind of adverb form, or "domi" is used
as a verb, as in "being home", and "an ki" means some kind of "human way of
going", or "a walking human". - I don't remember the rules of noun phrases; I
image that first go the adjectives, then the noun.

Anyway, in the glosa syntax, it isn't clear how the words work: as a noun, as a
verb, as an adverb, as an adjective... (I talk using the kind-words for european
languages).

Besides, there are sentences like "It's raining", which are translated almost
directly word-by-word to glosa. That kind of sentence is really strange to me.
There are more examples of sentences, which are strange to me.

I think that the esperanto syntax is quite simpler than glosa's.

I'd add to glosa some kind of words, which would tell about the "start of noun
phrase", and "start of verb phrase"... Even the "toki pona" language is clearer
than glosa about that.

I expect a more regular grammar, where I can syntactically understand a sentence
in _only one way_, where the syntactic sense of each word is uniquelly
determined.

The Esperanto grammar isn't flawless about that, I know. Everything has to be
improved. :)
Even the toki pona language isn't clear about that, by the strange use of words,
which may act as prepositions or as normal words.

I really like the idea of the glosa's morfology - null morfology. But there
should be more small-word marks for clearing the syntax, or at least, there
should be clear rules about the ellision of them (as done in the lojban
language). The syntax of the lojban language is quite good; it allows ellision
for the more usual sentences. It would be cool to get a similar regular grammar,
but with the target of having a language based in the grammar of the most commonnatural languages. :)

Uf. I imagine that my English is really poor. I may write in Esperanto quite
better; but I'll keep on with English, if the list members want.

I better take a look again to the small glosa's grammar descriptions ;)
I've almost forgot everything from them ;)

Bye!
