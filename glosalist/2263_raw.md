Dear Gary, I don't know well the origina=
l Latin, but classical Latin is what matters to Peano's Interlingua: the cl=
assical 3rd declension has E as its characteristic vowel. The 3rd declensio=
n has most of the nouns (38%, while 2nd has 32%, and 1st has 23%), and it i=
s the only "pan-gender" declension, which is an invaluable advantage. When =
they say "cave canem" they don't worry about the gender of the dog. But at =
"homo homini lupus", people may reply (and they continually do): why the ma=
sculine ("lupus") must represent both males and females?

I'm happy you agr=
ee that adding the E in conlangs is a good idea. Indeed I don't know any co=
nlang having all words with the same final vowel, but I'm trying so. If kee=
ping a reduced set of basic words about 1000 (and lots of compound words), =
and keeping a set of grammatical particles clearly indicated, then such a c=
onlang might work. Interglossa was partially trying this. It intended to be=
 an isolated language with no suffixes at all, but its several final vowels=
 (-a, -i / -o / -e) might be seen as actual suffixes. 

Greetings.
