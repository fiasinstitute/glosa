Only if this list has the power to change Glosa. It was very
frust=
rating a few years ago to propose changes, or debate options,
only to find =
out that nothing could change without Wendy's approval,
and she was not par=
t of the discussion.

There also seemed to be a sense that Glosa was "finis=
hed" and should
not be changed further. The "18 steps" seemed to be held up=
 as proper
Glosa for all time, regardless of what other changes might be
pa=
rtially adopted. Perhaps I misunderstood.

First, there must be a basic pro=
cess in place. Then we could discuss
specific questions and concerns about =
the language.

Please see the front page of my Tavo=
 site :

At the time I wrote that (four years ago), LFN =
was still a fully
inflected language. Otherwise, it still seems like a good=
 summary.
