Ahoy, again, Bill,

My guess is that the answer is no.
Wendy Ashby is titular head of Glosa at present, but she is not on 
the Mailing List, and is working, as if from a secretariat, selling 
dictionaries and communicating, by letter, internationally.

You could write to her and ask if she has applied for an ISO code, 
but I fear that such a thing is a bit too modern, even for 
me.  Please tell us all why Glosa needs such a code, and what it will 
do for the language to have one.

Quite sincerely,

Robin
    P.S. The address is: Glosa, PO Box 18, Richmond, Surry TW9 2AU, U.K.
