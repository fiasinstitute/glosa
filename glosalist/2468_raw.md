Hello!

The word QOD is okay according to the dictionary I'm using ("CENTRA=
L GLOSA. 5000 English into Glosa 1000 with Etymological Notes", 1993) :

WH=
AT, THAT WHICH =3D QOD
... WHICH ... =3D QI

ing to work out exactly what 'qod' means, comparing and contrasting it to '=
qi'.  It is not used in the "18 Steps" document.  In the online dictionary,=
 it means "what (that which)".  I found 2 uses among Ashby/Clark documents:=

it seems equivalent to 'u-la; qi' - that which.  Thus we could have the equ=
ivalent rewritings:

Is that how you all understand qod's meaning?  Other thoughts?

 I realize 2a violates the rule in 18 Steps stating that 'qi' should be omi=
tted in this case.  please overlook so we can focus on the main point.)
