Hi, 

Just joined. I definitely want to learn an IAL and my preliminary screening 
tells me that the two best choices are probably Glosa or IDO. I tend to 
prefer GLOSA. Would you have any article or site where I could find a 
comparison of the two, showing the advantages of Glosa over IDO? 

In fact if Glosa is the most recent of the IALs, created after having looked 
at all the other ones created earlier, is there not somewhere an article 
comparing advantageously Glosa to all the other main IAL? 



Thanks for your help.

PS: Is there a 'central authority' somewhere controlling the standards and 
the spreading of Glosa worldwide? The website www.glosa.org is very limited. 
What is the main website(s) about Glosa?
