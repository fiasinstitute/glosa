That is the same way I feel about the words 'like' and
'love'.  In English they are sometimes interchangeable as
in 'I like to ski' and 'I love to ski' but as an emotion
they are very different levels to be sure.  Tell a girl who
has just said "I love you" that you like her, and see what
I mean.   grin.
