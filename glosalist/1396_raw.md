Hello, Li Zhenyu,
Thanks you very much for your explanations, they proved=
 to be very useful. Besides, I've found some sample mp3 files at glosa.org.=
 Not 
too many, but they help a lot. On listening to them, however, I've go=
t some more questions. The "18 Steps" gives to the learners the following r=
ules: "Accent gently on vowel before last consonant" and "Pronounce vowels =
separately". Now, one of the readers pronounces the word auxi as ['auksi]; =
but the last consonant is "x", so why not [a'uksi]? 

These are some more e=
xamples from the same source where the readers don't follow the above menti=
oned rules: laevo is pronounced as ['l^evo], musea as [mu'se^], magika-fe a=
s ['m^gik^ 'fe. Why not [l^'evo], ['muse^] and [m^'gik^ 'fe]? 

Meticulousl=
y yours,
Oleg :-)
