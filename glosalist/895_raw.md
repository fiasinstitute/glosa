I'm sure that the new audio files would be much better than any existing audio material that I have heard.

Subject: [glosalist] Re: Activity

I think that would indeed be a good idea. The few mp3 files
that are availabe were far from ideal and most of them were
hard to hear and understand. 

I am working on a different text book and some translations
also. I don't know if they will be any better than any
others but I'd like to help and I needed a new writing
project.

I would like to find out more about the Glosa organization
as far as approval, decisions and suggestions about the
language. I have seen several very active members in this
list as I slowly read through the backlog of message, but I
am still unsure as to who has the final say. I have
several questions I'd like to get definitive answers to.

I guess we could make some audio files, post them and see
what everyone thinks.

Poli saluta,
Tom
