I placed my order for "Eighten Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa"! 
Shipping t=
ime, about two weeks :-(

I did download the online version, which I love, =
but it doesn't have 
all of Steps 4, 6-8, 10-12, and 14 & 15. :-(

It would=
 be fantastic if Wendy Ashby would allow the whole book to be 
viewed onlin=
e. I think that would help Glosa gain interest and support 
more than anyth=
ing.
