u andro pa itera feno ge enigma 
 
I agree ............ my confusion made more confused by an older version of  
g. 
i have tried to get round the problems by simplifying my dictionaries and  
being more precise with word order etc
i start my  verb phrases with pa , fu and du etc  [past future  and present 
continuous ] - this makes it easier to see when the subject ends and  the verb 
begins - i have found in hindi that it is not always to distinguish  verb from 
object phrases so i would prefer us to keep the svo order in glosa -  english 
puts modifiers [especially to verbs] in all sorts of orders - i suggest  all 
phrases u/plu etc or pa/fu/du etc simple modifiers, head verb/noun etc  
complex modifiers.
more to follow
syd
