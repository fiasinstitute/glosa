On Saturday I uploaded a new version with a slight improvement. 
Plurals en=
ding in 'cies' are now recognized as plurals of words ending
with 'cy'.  'M=
ercies' or 'fancies' are now recognized as plurals of
'mercy' and 'fancy', =
but 'currencies' is not recognized because
'currency' doesn't exist in the =
dictionary, even though 'current' does.
