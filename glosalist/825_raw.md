Could you explain w=
hat you mean? Based on what you wrote and a quick
read of the NSM material,=
 I would have reached an opposite conclusion.
If there really are a finite =
set of primitives from which all other
words can be derived, it would seem =
that a language could have a
vocabulary of just those primitives and still =
function (although
awkwardly). Something like Toki Pona, I suppose.

A lang=
uage of 1000 words, built around these universal primitives,
plus extra wor=
ds for convenience, seems very practical, based on this
reasearch.
