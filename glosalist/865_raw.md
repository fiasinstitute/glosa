In the previous upgrade I also limited the number of searches to those
whi=
ch occur when specific matches had been made of certain common
endings.  Pr=
evious to that the program would by default search for a
match of the words=
 without the last three letters, when searches based
on the letters of the =
common endings did not produce resulting
matches.  Following the same princ=
iple of yesterdays upgrade, the
program as uploaded today produces no resul=
ting matches when the
ending is a single s and there are only matches that =
add more letters
to the original.  Thus correspondence, for example, which =
in the
dictionary is defined as grama, returns a match when correspondences=

or corresponding occur but not when corresponds occurs, because
correspond=
 does not exist in the dictionary.  The idea is that
correspond will thus b=
e noticed and make it into the dictionary,
defined either as grama or some =
other word.  Todays upgrade also
recognizes plurals ending with 'es', the '=
ism' and 'ist' endings, and
more 'al' endings.  I plan to post the date of =
further upgrades at
