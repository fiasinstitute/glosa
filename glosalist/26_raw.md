Dear Jay and Charles,

I am really sorry about that.  My comment was stupid and I really
want to apologize for it.

You both have much in common:  you both love auxlangs, you both have
helped Glosa, you both have another favourite auxlang than Glosa, and
- that is sad, but seems unchangeable - you both hate each other.  I
think, all that is okay.

With my silly joke ("jayandcharles@yahoogroups.com") I just wanted to
say, that I cannot understand, why grown-up people who hate each other
cannot communicate directly without misusing a public mailing-list for
it.  Or better, why don't they simply avoid each other?  Again: sorry
for it.  I did not want to offend any of you both.  War-time and
hate-time is not joke-time, we do not need awkward jokes but
understanding, peace and love.  And for that we need a world language
for better communication very quickly!

I ask both of you, please stop it.  I would be very happy, if noone of
you will answer this letter with explanations, that the other is the
"perpetrator" and so on.

Glosalist has problems enough:  If we stay at zeta.org, we will loose
members by virus attacks.  If we change over to another provider, we
will loose members, because not everyone feels like passing a new
register procedure.  Glosa will lose anyway.  Please do not make it
worse.

I now have started to forward manually all mails of
glosalist@... to yahoo.  So if you read
groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist you will be virus-free, you will not
miss a message, but you will have a delay.

Sad, that the new archive started with personal attacks already.

Saluta - Marcel
