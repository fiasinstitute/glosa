A.)
When I first =
met English, I wondered how a language that don't use inflections can expre=
ss all the human idea.
And I found the English extremly useful.
But then, I=
 had to get to know of it's secrets. So, that is possible only if there are=
 a very big amount of expressions that helps you to express yourself in con=
formity with yours requirement. And those expressions mainly don't give you=
 a logical sense of the meaning of it's words, but you must learn it's mean=
ing in advance.
As me, that takes more time, then if you were using infleks=
ions (of course, I thought only about inflected plannad languages).

I don'=
t master Glosa, but I hope that it don't follows that way of English, which=
 made you to learn an enormous quantity of expressions.

B.)
Why Glosa didn=
't get spread? I think, that it could be becouse there aren't dictionaries =
and coursebooks all around the world. And which is more important (as me), =
you can't read enough immaginative literature that could give you command i=
n a language.
Even "Ido" din't get spread because of the same thing, althou=
gh it is better than Esp.
