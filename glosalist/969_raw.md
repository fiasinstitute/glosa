Perhaps by placing the discrepant words side-by-side with
corresponding Lat=
in and Greek root words in actual usage it would help
others learn Glosa.  =
The whole idea behind Glosa is that people leave
behind their petty quibble=
s over this word or that one, and actually
communicate something useful.  I=
've updated my site to include a
search engine for Rogets Thesaurus in Engl=
ish and Glosa.  Perhaps you
can use it to find out what the actual usage is=
 of words that appear
to diverge from their original Latin and Greek meanin=
gs.  I've also
added a file containing the Thesaurus to the files section o=
f this
website.
