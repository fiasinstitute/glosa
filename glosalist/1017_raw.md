The Glosa is a very intresting auxilary language for me.

I seek Russian speakers who are intresting Glosa. Write me directly, please.

I have some questions about pronunciation.
1 what is correct accent grAtia or gratIa?
2I hear in audio examples that sometime S sound like Z (as in Zoo)
especially in intervocal position (as in German)
3 In word 'gratia' I hear T sound like TS. Is it correct?

Thanks.
