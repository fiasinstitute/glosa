Marcel,
This is uncalled for, I see my name is again 
badmouthed on this list and I really wish
this be stopped. I've not used vulgarities,
which Charles has, I've not insulted others
as Charles has, I've not put down Glosa
as Charles has. I've supported Glosa
for a number of years, I've put up info
on it on the web when there was little
of it, I was one of the first folks to join
this list. Now please, I am not happy 
that the person who has abused my 
name time and again remains on this
list. I've sent a request to unsubscribe
and received no confirmation as of yet.

I'm virus free thanks to my anti-virus
program, which automatically deletes
any messages which it flags as infected.
I also filter out anything coming from
Charles and it ends up where it belongs,
in the trash bin.

Now, I'm requesting that Robin unsubscribe
me from this list if Charles is to continue on
it. He's shown time and again he's not interested
in the promotion of Glosa and only demeans
the language and those who use it. Robin,
should make a decision. Mine is already 
made.

Sincerely
Jay B.
