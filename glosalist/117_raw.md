Karo Glosa-pe,
  Marcel has it right: italic doesn't work on Yahoo.
  I have used it on my ancient website.  For differentiation purposes,
without 'bold', 'italic' and 'underline' (and colour) we have only two
modes: CAPITALS & lower case.
  I shall learn to live with it.  But I find it highly unimaginative of
Yahoo to have lumped these "formats" in with HTML.
  Maybe I'll just have to up my own creativity to make up for Yahoo's lack
of it.  I already use some special markings, viz
   ^idioms^
   [English version]
   ~Glosa reported speech~
   *  My comments.

  It looks as if, when I want to discriminate within a sentence, I might
have to try harder, such as
   it was -this particular bit- I changed
   here we have the /technical term/
   the Glosa rule is #here#
   he said ~the other bloke said <this>~
   etc.

^Where there's a will, there's a way^,
