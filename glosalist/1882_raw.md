t's pretty easy to make fast progress with the language (because of the lan=
guage's isolating character and its small number of roots).  I started lear=
ning the language in December of last year, and it's pretty easy for me to =
converse and translate using the language now.

 I would like to know what is the best dictionary of GLOSA I may use to lea=
rn the language now. If possible, a dictionary indicating the categories of=
 every word (n., v., adj., adv., prep., and so on).

 of Interglossa presented the vocabulary in this way.
