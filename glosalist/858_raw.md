Just to inform you all that an even newer version of the program has
been =
uploaded ( you may have to press the refresh button ).  The
noticeable diff=
erence in this one is that it contains its own
specialized dictionary file,=
 which for the sake of plain rationality
has only one definition per word, =
as chosen by me.  In fact, you can
manually edit this file; as long as you =
stick to the format, which
can't be any simpler, it will translate any word=
 into any other word
you want.
