Hi Bill,
         I suspect not.
         The little booklet has illustrations, and this made it 
difficult in the early days of Glosa promotion to reproduce it electronically.

         If I had one, I'd now scan it and send it to you as an 
attachment, but no such luck.  It is educationally primitive in its 
teaching method, but there has been nothing else produced.  I did 
research into superior language teaching books, and should have 
stopped everything else, and had a go.  However, instead, I got 
sucked into pointless, endless discussions on Glosa vocabulary.  What 
a waste of time and opportunity.

         I suggest that while you are waiting for "18 Steps" to reach 
you via snail-mail, or for someone with a a scanner to copy it and 
email it to you, you could hunt down my Seminar #1 and Seminar #2.

         I am quite pleasantly surprised by the current rush of 
philosophical discussion on Glosa, but it is about ten years too late 
for me.  For reasons of bad economics, I am spending most of my time 
now racking my brain as to how I might start generating wealth again, 
to allow me to get on with my retirement.

         Maybe my e-Book on music will take off, and I can stop 
worrying so much about money.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
