a rethink about my fairly radical suggestions - "t" and "k" are plosives,  
the tip of the tongue is pressed against the top of the mouth to stop the flow  
of air and the the air is released with a very mild explosion. "k" is similar  
but at the back of the mouth - "d" and "g" are similar but with the voice 
used .  "s" and "z" are like "t" and "d" but the tongue only partly blocks the 
air flow  and adds a hissing sound - these letters are already used in glosa and 
so will  not serve my purpose. if the sound "k" is modified in the same way 
we get a  letter that is variously spelled as "kh" , "ch" and "x", i have 
suggested "x" in  glosa could be used for the same purpose, if this letter is 
voiced we get "gh"  .......  this is not used in glosa so that it could help very 
quietly, to  separate two vowels that are pronounced,  it  need not be written 
but  left to the speaker's discretion. so we could have - " u gina (gh)e (gh)u 
 (gh)andro (gh)es in u horti". between "s" and "x" we have "sh" which might 
be  better to use - "u gina (sh)e (sh)u (sh)andro (sh)es in u horti"
between consonants we could say but not write shwa a vague vowel sound in  
between  the other 5  - 
"q"- we are asked to actually say "k" + "w",  "w" is not in glosa's  letter 
set so is replaced by "u" - if "k" is followed by "u" there is a tendency  to 
pronounce it further back in the mouth so that it sounds like the "q" in IPA  - 
the initial sound in "ke" and "que" are not quite the same so we could retain 
 "q"
i've become somewhat verbose - sorry
