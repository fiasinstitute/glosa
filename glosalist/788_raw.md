Karo glosa-pe,

I recently had some spare time, and created a new version o=
f the
GlosaReader program:

* The basic functionality didn't change, so you=
 still copypaste some
text into it and move the mouse over words to get tra=
nslations
* The lookup routine is now error-tolerant, e.g. it looks in the
=
dictionary for the 20 best matching words (not only exact matches)
* The lo=
okup of words is delayed a short time, so you have the chance
to move the m=
ouse to the lower part of the program and inspect the
looked up words
* You=
 can integrate the application into your webpages, showing a text
of your c=
hoice

You find the new version here:
http://www.eikepreuss.de/glosa/glosar=
eader/index.html
and have a look on an example that runs online here (this =
requires
a Java(tm) Plugin Version 1.4 or greater; see above page for more =
info):

Cheers=
, Eike
