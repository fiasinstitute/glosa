I desire to be strong.'  I don't really like this solution but it is a solu=

"Mi desira es forti" mean=
s "my desire is strong", because the "es" impedes a direct modifier-modifie=
d relationship between desira and forti.  Take it out and "mi desira forti"=
 literally means "my desiring strength".  The context will determine if tha=
t is what is  actually meant rather than "I desire to be strong" or "I desi=
re strength".
