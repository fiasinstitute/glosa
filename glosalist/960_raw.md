you are too unkind on yourself - glosa needs lots of criticism, don't we  all 
- your comments are very valuable and you have people who agree 
let's go back to my first meeting with glosa - it seemed to me that g was  
going to be a very useful tool for communication so i read further. most of the  
letters seemed to me as an englishman logical til i came across q x - the 
rule  is to have one sound for each letter yet we have x (k+s) and q(k + w) the  
prounciation of the rest was vaguely english - if that is how g is 
constructed,  i shall go no further  ........... i wonder how many sympathisers g has  
lost within the first 24 letters ..........
a simple change would have encouraged us to continue
APL +u after q
however i persiveared (i can't spell that word after nearly 80 years of my  
own language
more to follow
