but isn't kw 2 soundings?
unvoiced velar fricative plus unviced bilabial approximant
ks u v f plus unvoiced dental fricative
c is ok unvoiced palatal fricative
we have had one or two people in the past who have commented on this  
perculiarity and appear to have been lost to us
 
we have rule 1, we are phonetic EXCEPT
rule 2, x = k+s
rule 3, s + c =  ubvoiced palatal fricative
rule 4, q = k +w (which latter is not in the glosa alphabet!)
 
people must think we are crackers!
ipa have done the work for us nearly 100 years ago
 
so rule 1, each glosa letter is pronounced as in IPA //.... large full  stop 
IPA is the same in all languages
