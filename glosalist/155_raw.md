My bad mistake in "Roberti" raises interesting points.

"Roberti", pa dice Beti.
"Robert", said Betty.
If one says the English sentence, the punctuation is inaudible. We now have:- 
'Roberti said Betty'.
Usual order - S V O gives 'R said "Betty" ', what is required is:- ' "Robert" 
was said by Betty'. ' "Roberti", pa gene/ge Beti'.
If I am talking to someone with the same language and accent as mine 
(northern English), he/she would understand my elisions of "was" and "by" and my 
intonation; it is now more concise and more forceful - bad grammar but good style. 
However, if the listener is not English, my statement is bad international 
language. Glosa is meant to be an international language therefore, - ' "R" pa 
dice B' -  is BAD Glosa.
plu mi penite.

We should always bear in mind that our Glosa is aimed at some person perhaps 
isolated in the wilds of a little visited country far from one's own.
