saluta robin
in penguin thesaurus index is "totter"
= 278 
there are  990 altogether
in section 278 there are 8 paragraphs,  at the 
 
4th is "move slowly"
in that there are 10 words in italics in the 2nd 
 
"flow" , in that group there are 29 words 
 
"totter" is the 7th  
 
you could have 278/990+4/8+2/10+7/29
so perhaps:-  7+200+40000+278000000=
278400207  divide by 80 several  times:-
3480002 remainder .5875  *80=47
43500.025=2
543.75=60
6.7875=63
we have the remainders  47,2,69,63,6
divide these by 5
9 remainder 2
0 2
13 4
12 3
1  1
column 1 is for consonants , 2 is for  vowels

ni bi vu so ce  "nibivusoce" = "totter"
in  fact, when i was working on this, i used a 
 
better method and got much shorter words
do this to "shamble" might give  something like 
 
"nibivuteve" related english words give similar 
 
sounding words
this has not much to do with glosa nor is in 
 
glosa so apologies to marcel but glosa could 
 
learn .......
