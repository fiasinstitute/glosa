Sure. Very bad.

I can give the example of "loglan" and lojban.  By now, t=
here are much
more speakers of lojban than those of loglan. I cite from Wik=
ipedia,
but surely you may be able to find more faithful sources:
http://en=
.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban_language
 A Washington DC splinter group, which =
later formed The Logical
Language Group, LLG, decided in 1986 to remake the=
 entire vocabulary
of Loglan in order to evade Dr. Brown's claim of copyrig=
ht to the
language. After a lengthy battle in court, his claim to copyright=
 was
ruled invalid. By then, though, the new vocabulary was already
cemente=
d as a part of the new language, which was called Lojban: A
realization of =
Loglan by its supporters.

In fact it was considered that if the vocabulary=
 of the language is
different from another, that's enough for considering i=
t "another
language", so, not violating the copyrights.

I fear it's the op=
posite of the actual case (sure we wouldn't immitate
the grammar with other=
 words ;).

Well, there is the 'foundation', which is "un=
touchable" by now. :) But
if someone makes a modification of Esperanto, (as=
 Ido may be), noone
complains. :) Let there be other languages, deriving fr=
om other ones.
It's always been like this, isn't it? ;)

- I don't know if =
my last mail about 'English' reached the list... I
had some problems, due t=
o a new email address.

Bye!
