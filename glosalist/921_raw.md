OK, I'm slow but I think I'm beginning to get the idea. I believe 
the foun=
ders of the language did not wish to clearly define all the 
details. They =
wanted YOU as users of the language to decide. They 
published many differe=
nt variations (formats) of the language so 
that you (users) will choose th=
e ones you like and use them, and 
ignore the ones you don't like and let t=
hem fall into disuse. THAT 
will decide the course of the language, not som=
e authority who signs 
the final decision. (That seems to be the way things=
 are going 
whether the founders actually intended or not.) 
 
This is a gr=
eat idea. But, I have a little concern with this 
"democratic" approach. Th=
e Glosa community is quite small. And I get 
the sense that the most are an=
glophone. That means as the time goes 
by Glosa will be more and more Engli=
sh like, quashing wishes of the 
minorities (it is pro English biased to be=
gin with). It would 
eventually become an English Auxiliary Language instea=
d of 
International Auxiliary Language. 
 
I may occasionally be putting my=
 two bits out there as a minority, 
which some of you may not like. I apolo=
gize, if so. As it is now, it 
seems to me the person who has the greatest =
power is the person who 
maintains the website(s). (I have seen some "error=
s" in the 
website ;-)
