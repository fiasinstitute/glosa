Thanks for that.

I can't get hold of anyone at www.secondhand-bookshop.co.=
uk (and their web site searching and ordering doesn't seem to work) and so =
have ordered from Waterstones, who have subsequently sent me an email to sa=
y that it is unavailable from their suppliers.

I know that it is available=
 on the Glosa web site - I have it printed out - but wanted the 'real' copy=
 to get the missing examples from the book that are omitted in the online v=
ersion.

Again, thanks for taking the time to reply.
