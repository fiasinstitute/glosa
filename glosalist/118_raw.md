Dear Robin,

I'm afraid you have missed the point.  My translation of the _Qo akti?_
article does not differ from your translation (which is indeed a very
understandable translation based on logic) because of my perception of
German, but because my perception of Glosa differs from yours.

You have pointed out that Glosa semantics are based more on vocabulary
than grammar.  What if a Glosa word has a different meaning in my head
than it has in yours?  Certainly, Glosa words are not yet that clearly
defined.

For example, I said:

>"Homo solve _anti_ lingua difere..."

You said:

>"Iso u solutio _ad_ difere de lingua..."

I perceived problems caused by language diversity as something to be
"fought against."  You perceived them as something a solution can be
"applied to."  The original German really had more the idea that you
translated, even though you do not know German.  (German uses the
preposition _fï¿½r_, more akin to the English "for.")  Logic is a tool that
in my hand produced one translation and in your hand produced another. 
One translation might be more understandable to one person and the other
to another.  If there were a REGULAR USAGE of either preposition that
could be asserted, there would be no argument here.  (Or perhaps just my
own personality or feelings about international auxilary languages is
showing through.)

There are also grammar differences.  I like Hogben's idea of "amplifier,"
as seen in my translation here:

>Cina-pe detekti id ma no-facili.  [Chinese find it _more difficult_.]

What Hogben calls an amplifier would be called an _appositive_ in English
in this instance.  (The phrase "more difficult" modifies "it.")  Many
languages use appositives.  Your solution was a structure using the
preposition _kausa_.  Both are understable to me, and both use logic.

One of Noam Chomsky's favorite sentences was:

>Fighting tigers can be dangerous.

This sentence is ambiguous.  Does it mean:

>gerund / object of gerund / modal / verb / adjective 
>Fighting       tigers               can         be    dangerous.

or:

>present participle / subject / modal / verb / adjective
>     Fighting              tigers       can       be    dangerous.

Esperantists are proud of the fact that such ambiguities cannot occur in
their language.  Does this make English inferior to Esperanto?  No,
English can restate the sentences with the proper information to remove
the ambiguities when this is needed:

>Fighting with tigers can be dangerous.
>Tigers that fight can be dangerous.

What a headache for a translator who gets only the ambiguous sentence! 
Every language contains different information attached to its words. 
Translators must sometimes supply missing information or opt to leave out
information that is not usually contained in the second language.  This
leads to differing translations by more than one translator and even
mistakes.  The proverbial "It loses something in the translation" also
applies here.

By the way, Glosa shares the same structures as English:

>Pugna tigri posi es risko.
>Pugna anti tigri posi es risko.
>Tigri; qi pugna, posi es risko.

Using the verboid also helps here:

>Akti pugna anti tigri es risko.  (_Akti_ makes _pugna_ an object,
requiring the use of a preposition to connect it with _tigri_.)

I admire the flexibility of Glosa, as I do the interesting differences in
our translations.

Saluta,
 _  _
