1] i am inclined to leave out caps altogether as do hindi urdu etc
2] there has been some discussion on them in glosa but their use seems to  be 
very vague start sentence with one "proper" nouns do but what exactly is  
"proper" what happens if the first word is the head of a noun phrase and is also  
proper? or other combinations 
i think head capital is a good idea. could you tell me the precise and  clear 
rules for their use?
