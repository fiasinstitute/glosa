Also me! Really, I like very much the Esperanto's s=
ystem and I think
that the Glosa's vortaro is a nice thing.

The endings are the basically system =
in Esperanto to recognize the
word-role, and we can nicely use them with fr=
eedom. Glosa, without
endings, need an other system to give a same liberty.=
 So the problem
stay : how understand what word explain the action, what wo=
rd is a
noun, what word is a modifier...

with it.

I am in accord with you!
1)=
to can say what I want to say
2)others can understand what I want to say
3)=
and nobody depreciate my style!
I look for this : each expresses himself as=
 he can, the only condition
is that the others understand. This need any ru=
les, the way for learn
the rules is a problem of pedagogy, important but di=
fferent.
