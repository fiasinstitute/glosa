First make it Glosa -> Esperanto, so you can read and understand =
Glosa
in Esperanto.  This is easier and more practical than Esperanto ->
Gl=
osa because Glosa has only one word for each concept, and relies on
the use=
r to give a meaningful context to those concepts so that the
precise meanin=
g becomes evident.  I am working on Glosa -> English and
Glosa -> Spanish p=
rograms, and will make the wordlists available so
that others can use them =
to translate Glosa into their own languages.
