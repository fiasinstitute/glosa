The problem was wi=
th the HTML markup.  It seems to be displaying
properly now.  The headers a=
re now centered, the page names have been
changed to reflect the contents, =
and the tables have been increased in
width.  I had originally planned to p=
ut equivalents to Rogets words
for Dutton Speedwords, Gilo, and Sona, but I=
 think it would probably
just be confusing things too much.  The Glosa word=
s by themselves are
rich enough to suggest many meanings that enrich the te=
xt of Roget
itself, rather than only trying to borrow from it.
