Well Friends,
         Yes, this is ^a shot across the stern^ But there could be a 
message in it for us.

         Have Glosa-pe spent a lot of time squabbling over spelling? 
Possibly...
but now read on:-


  I cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty
  uesdnatnrd
  waht I was
  rdgnieg.The
  phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid Aoccdrnig to
  rscheearch at Cmabrigde
  Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the
  ltteers in a wrod are,
  the
  olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat
  ltteer be in the rghit
  pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can
  sitll raed it wouthit a
  porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not
  raed ervey lteter by
  istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Amzanig huh?

First and last only?!   Huh!?
         Maybe the inside letters are not all that important after 
all - at least for the purposes of reading !!!

Saluta,

Robin
