	When the form of Sandridge had disappeared, loping his big dun down
the steep banks of the Frio crossing, the Kid crept back to his own
horse, mounted him, and rode back along the tortuous trail he had
come.
> Kron Sandridge gene es ab vista, tem sti; an mega tera-kroma equs kine kata plu fo-klina litora de trans-lo de fluvi Frio, u Juve-an klepto-kine ad auto equs, sedi epi an, e re-viagia longi kurva via; longi qi an pa veni.

	But not far.
> Sed ne tele.

He stopped and waited in the silent depths of the pear until half an
hour had passed.
> An sto kine, e atende in silento tele-lo, a-kron hemi horo gene spende.

And then Tonia heard the high, untrue notes of his unmusical singing
coming nearer and nearer; and she ran to the edge of the pear to meet
him.
> Po-co Tonia audi; plu alti, no-korekti fono de an no-musika kanta kine ma e ma proxi.  Po-co fe dromo a margina de kaktus, tende saluta ad an.
