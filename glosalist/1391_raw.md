My name is Oleg, I live in Moscow, Russia. One of my hobbies is Esperanto, =
and I'm a committed supporter of the idea of introducing an international a=
uxillary language throughout the world. Not long ago I came across Glosa an=
d it seemed a very interesting language to me, so I decided to make an atte=
mpt at mastering it. I've just begun studying the manual "18 Steps to Fluen=
cy in Glosa", but have got some questions already. 

I would be very gratef=
ul if someone could check whether I understood the pronunciation (and stres=
s placement especially) of the following words correctly (I used the ASCII =
Phonetic Alphabet for english pronunciation described at http://www.antimoo=
n.com/how/pronunc-ascii.htm):

televisio [telev'isio]
ciana     [tSi'ana]
g=
estio    ['gestio]
leuko     [le'uko]
lingua    [l'ingua]
sue       ['sue]
=
piano     [pi'^no]
anua      ['^nu^]
viagia    [vi'^gi^]
 
Thank you in adv=
ance,
Oleg
