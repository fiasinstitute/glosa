I was thinking about translating some wikis at wikipedia.org to 
Glosa toda=
y as an exercise to continue studying Glosa. I found that 
the language is =
not represented there even though both Esperanto and 
Ido has a presence. 
=

Does anyone know if any requests to add Glosa to the site have been 
submi=
tted? If so, what were the results?

If not, I may try submit for the inclu=
sion of Glosa.

Here are some relevant links:
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wik=
i/Requests_for_new_languages
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conlang=
s/Alternative_proposal

It seems from the above links that they are aware o=
f the existence 
of Glosa already and on writer has expressed a little surp=
rise at 
the lack of Glosa presence on the site.
