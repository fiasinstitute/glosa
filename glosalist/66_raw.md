The international language Ido - a general description

It would be very useful if we could talk with people in other 
countries, or correspond with them, as we can with people in our own 
country. However, the language barrier often makes this difficult if 
not impossible.

The answer to this problem given by many people is: let them (that 
is, everyone else) learn English! Certainly English is the most 
widely spoken language in the world, but it requires a lot of time 
and some skill to learn it at all well, and it is far from 
universally spoken. Moreover, because it is the language of certain 
countries, it is not a neutral language. For those who speak English, 
"let them learn English" may be an attractive answer, but the French, 
for example, see things differently.

Therefore the UN has five official languages, and UNESCO has eight. 
The European Community/Union has a similar number, and spends vast 
amounts of money on translation and interpreting. Although English 
and French predominate in the EC/EU, the Germans are now asking for 
German to be used more.

Using just one national language would give enormous political and 
cultural advantages to the country or countries for which the chosen 
language is the native tongue. Consequently this solution is often 
unacceptable to the others, although the Universal Postal Union still 
uses French as its official language.

The answer to this situation is to use a neutral invented language 
like Esperanto or Ido. Such a language would not replace natural 
languages (that would be vandalism) but be used as a bridge between 
people who otherwise could not communicate. In this way we can meet 
each other half way, with little or no advantage for any one group.

The chosen language should not be too artificial. The vocabulary 
should be based on existing languages (some of which already have 
many words in common, despite differences in spelling and 
pronunciation). The grammar should be as simple as possible, without 
all the exceptions and idiomatic uses which plague the learner of 
national languages.

This idea inspired among others Father Schleyer, the inventor of 
Volapuk, and Dr L. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, whose 
language remains the best known of its type over a century since it 
was first launched. After some years of trying it (and some earlier 
and later inventions) in practice, various improvements were 
suggested.

For example, Zamenhof required adjectives in Esperanto to agree in 
number and case with the nouns they qualify, so an adjective has four 
possible endings. There is no real need for this complication, as 
English and Hungarian - with their invariable adjectives - show, and 
as Zamenhof later agreed. However, for various reasons no changes 
were made to the rules of Esperanto.

It was on the basis of improvements such as this that a group of 
scientists and linguists developed Ido. The committee included the 
Danish linguist Professor Otto Jespersen and the French mathematician 
and philosopher Professor Louis Couturat. They took the best from 
Esperanto and from another invention, Idiom Neutral, added further 
improvements, and developed a language which is almost certainly the 
easiest in the world, yet at the same time one of the most precise.

Another improvement was one which again Zamenhof had pointed out 
would be very logical and convenient. In Esperanto words for people 
and animals (words such as 'actor' or 'lion') tend to be for the 
male, with the word for the female being derived by using a suffix 
(often '-ess' in English). The alternative Zamenhof later preferred, 
but unfortunately did not implement, is to make such words neutral 
(like 'cousin' and 'pilot' in English), and to derive both male and 
female forms by use of appropriate suffixes.

Ido also has a useful pronoun, as does Finnish, which means either he 
or she, and can therefore be used whenever it is irrelevant or 
unnecessary to be more specific. Some people wish we had such a 
pronoun in English so as to avoid saying 'he or she' or writing 
'he/she' or 's/he'!

In Ido, therefore, but not in Esperanto, these and other improvements 
were adopted, and the result is preferred by nearly everyone who has 
studied equally these two semi-artificial international languages or 
dialects which otherwise share much in common - including the 
inspiration of Schleyer and in particular of Zamenhof.

It is to the credit of the Esperanto movement that, through its 
undoubted fervour, it has done so much to make the idea of a neutral 
international language relatively well known. However, although 
Esperanto is widely known about, and is a relatively easy language, 
its special accented letters and unnecessary complications have put 
off many who are attracted by the idea it represents. Ido carries 
forward where Esperanto left off.

Those who have experienced Ido know how good it is being able to 
concentrate on what you want to say and not having to think, at the 
same time, about how you have to say it.

So much for the theory, but how does it work in practice? 
International gatherings of people who speak Ido have taken place in 
a number of countries and have demonstrated that the idea really 
works in practice.

There are many publications in or about Ido, including vocabularies 
and grammar books for speakers of a variety of languages from Swedish 
to Japanese. There is even a surprising amount of poetry in Ido, 
including a wonderful 'heroical-comical' story in verse (Andreas 
Juste's La Serchado). There is a new world waiting to be discovered 
by anyone who makes the small effort required to understand this 
remarkable language.

Using the language is a hobby in itself of course, as well as a way 
of contributing to better understanding in the world.
