Karo plu lista-pe

I've decided to adapt some old teaching materials for
use with Glosa. I'd be pleased if some folk would care
to post some Glosa translations of the first lesson's
phrases {or at least of the more interesting ones :)}.
I'll post a link so you can see my efforts in a few
days {when I get it done}.
