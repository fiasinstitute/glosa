Hello Oleg - welcome to Glosa - I see that your queries have been answered by Zhenyu so will make no further comment.   My name is David - I live on the east coast of England about 32 kilometres from Norwich.   I also was interested in Esperanto but that was a good few years ago and when I discovered Glosa (derived from InterGlossa) I thought it to be a much better proposition for an international language.   Regrettably I am not so good at learning languages but have the same ambition as yourself with regard to the introduction of an international language.
   Regards,    David.
