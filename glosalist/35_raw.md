Teehee, I was careful to *not* check the notify-everybody box,
but I didn't know that it automagically notifies the list owner!
Reasonable, I suppose, but really, I didn't mean to flood your
mailbox!

I also downloaded a few of those files later to make sure they
transferred okay; it was fun leafing through those old messages.
I'd forgotten about some of Glosa's dictionary idiosyncracies,
like lots of words for boggy, marshy, wet woodland places but
no word for boots or socks or some kind of footwear (I forget
which) that I thought would have been useful in such places.
And I still suspect that a language which has a special word
for "big breasts" (BUMASTA) must reveal some psychological
insight about its creator! And then there was the "mad rabbi
raging" phrase that has stuck in my mind ever since; perhaps
due to a typo, or maybe a scanning error, RABI was defined by
those three words in the original file; I decided that "rabbi"
was meant to be "rabid", then it all made sense.

Saluta, salata, vale...
Bill
