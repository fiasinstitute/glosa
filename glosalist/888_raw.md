It took me longer than expected but I go the file converted to the  
Superm=
emo program format for the Palm OS.

I wanted to ask some question that may=
 have already been answered in 
the list so far but I have only made it up =
to the 200 range. So I 
apologize in advance for repeating...

Is the langu=
age set as it is not except for vocabulary changes?

Is there a reason the =
ten or deka is not used in numbers greater than 
10? like 16 - deka sixa  o=
r 45 - tetra deka pen?  I ask because it is 
used that way for hundred in t=
he material I have read.  200 is  bi 
hekto.   So 231 is bi hekto tri mo, n=
ot bi hekto tri deka mo.  It is 
a bit longer but I think clearer. The way =
it is now is not similar to 
other languages and not intuitive. Also I thin=
k it might be confusing 
with large numbers.


Has anyone heard of the "Kur=
so de Esperanto' Program? Take a look.
http://www.cursodeesperanto.com.br/b=
azo/index.php?en

I think it would be easy and useful to attempt to create =
a version 
for Glosa. All you have to do I contact the author I think, for =

permission. And make the files and audio. Not that difficult.

Is the Plu =
Glosa Nota still being printed/published?

What is being done to increase a=
wareness of Glosa?

Anything I can do to help?

And i am running out of tim=
e, So I will send this out now...


Thanks!
