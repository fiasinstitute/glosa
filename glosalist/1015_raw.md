Hi,

I just started studying glosa, and I have one comment and one
question.

The comment is that I started a ##glosa irc channel on freenode, and
I would welcome anyone to come and talk about and/or in glosa there to
learn with me.

The question is about the pronunciation of "O".  The tutorial I read
contained two conflicting pieces of information--that glosa's vowels
sound like the vowels of Spanish, and that "O" is pronounced like
English "AW".  Pronouncing "O" like "AW" seems awkward an unnatural to
me.  "O", as in "bone", is perhaps the simplest vowel sound for humans
to make.  Does glossa truly lack this sound?  Why?

Thank you,
John Foerch
