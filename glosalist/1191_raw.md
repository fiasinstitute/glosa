I feel that one of the reasons Glosa is not growing is because of lack of f=
ormal instruction and training. I bet that if we were anything like the peo=
ple fron Toki Pona, we'd probably be heading the same direction.

=
Ave!

Here's hoping, Doro. Glosa is too beautiful and easy an AIL to lose t=
o
obscurity. It seems the Novial community is on the fast track to
inactivi=
ty and I just don't want to see the same thing happen to our
community. Of =
the three AIL's that I have knowledge in (Esperanto,
Glosa, Novial) I find =
Glosa to be the most efficient and fun to use.

Plu saluta,
Scott
