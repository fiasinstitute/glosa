The hyphen joins together words closely associated seman=
tically

So pretty much dependent on how you are thinking of the concept wh=
en 
you write; are viewing the concept as a whole unit, then hyphenate

In =
Interglossa, Hogben rejected suffixes and prefixes, though allowed 
indepen=
dent words to be used in equivalent roles linked with hyphens

His argument=
 seems to be on word economy grounds: why do you need re- 
in re-paint when=
 you already have again and so can say paint again? 
and so on through the =
rest ...
