I have 30 USD for GEO, but how to send from Moscow, Russia ?
I have no expirience

Especially, I would know about etimology of glosa-words.
Is there anything in Inet, not only mark G in dictionry, but full version?

Thanks for History

Nikolao

P.S. I search the full gram. and dictionry of  language NEO by Arturo
Alfandari, 1960-years
In Inet I see very little on this intresting project. Some links are dead.
