	While they fared the Kid sang.
> Tem mu akti, u Juve-an du kanta.

He knew but one tune and sang it, as he knew but one code and lived
it, and but one girl and loved her.
> An ski solo mono kanta, e akti id, homo an ski solo mono regula-fa, e akti id, e mono gina, e filo fe.

He was a single-minded man of conventional ideas.
> An pa es u mono-buta andro ex plu vulga idea.

He had a voice like a coyote with bronchitis, but whenever he chose to
sing his song he sang it.
> An habe u kanta-pote homo u Canis latrans ko pulmona pato.  Anti-co ali-kron an elekti akti u kanta, an akti id.
