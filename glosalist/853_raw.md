I've discovered a small error in the program, and uploaded the
corrected ve=
rsion.  In assigning the plural to words, it would leave
out a hyphen, whic=
h would indicate that the 'plu' part was part of the
conjectured word.  For=
 example, 'endings' would return '?plu akro'
instead of '?plu-akro'.  If yo=
u have the version that does this,
perhaps you might want to download the c=
orrected version.
